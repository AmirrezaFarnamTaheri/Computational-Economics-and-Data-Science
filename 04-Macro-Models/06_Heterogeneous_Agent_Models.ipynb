    "### 1. Introduction: The HANK Revolution\n",
    "This chapter explores the frontier of modern macroeconomic research: **Heterogeneous Agent New Keynesian (HANK)** models. These models represent a major leap forward by combining the rich household heterogeneity from the Aiyagari/Krusell-Smith tradition with the nominal rigidities and monetary policy framework of New Keynesian economics.\n",
    "\n",
    "The motivation is simple: the real world is populated by diverse households, and this diversity matters for policy. The **Marginal Propensity to Consume (MPC)**—the fraction of an extra dollar of income that is spent—is not a single number, but a distribution. It is high for poor, credit-constrained households and low for wealthy households. HANK models, by explicitly modeling this distribution, provide a much more realistic and nuanced analysis of how monetary and fiscal policies affect the economy.\n",
    "\n",
    "They show that the traditional view of monetary policy working through intertemporal substitution is incomplete. Instead, the most powerful effects work indirectly through general equilibrium effects on labor income, which are then amplified by the high MPCs of a large fraction of the population. This has profound implications for how we think about the role and power of both monetary and fiscal stabilization policy."

    "Before diving into the full HANK framework, we start with the **Two-Agent New Keynesian (TANK)** model, developed by Galí, López-Salido, and Vallés (2007). It provides a tractable way to introduce a simple but powerful form of heterogeneity.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model splits the population into two types:\n",
    "1.  **Ricardian Households**: These are the standard, forward-looking agents who save and borrow to smooth consumption.\n",
    "2.  **Hand-to-Mouth (HtM) Households**: These agents simply consume their current disposable income in every period.\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Government**: Issues bonds to finance its expenditures and potentially makes transfer payments. It must satisfy an intertemporal budget constraint.\n",
    "\n",
    "**General Equilibrium**: The model is closed by finding a set of prices (wages, interest rates) and policy functions such that all agents are optimizing, markets clear, and the government budget constraint holds. A key difference from TANK models is that the interest rate directly affects the returns for *all* households who are saving, creating a richer feedback loop."
