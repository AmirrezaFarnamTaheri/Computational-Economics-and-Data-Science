    "The theory of **assortative matching**, pioneered by Gary Becker, addresses the question of *who matches with whom* when agents are heterogeneous. The key concept is **supermodularity**. If the production function $F(k,h)$ (where $k$ is firm productivity and $h$ is worker skill) is supermodular, meaning $\\frac{\\partial^2 F}{\\partial k \\partial h} > 0$, then the marginal product of skill is higher at more productive firms. This creates an incentive for **Positive Assortative Matching (PAM)**, where high-skill workers match with high-productivity firms, as this maximizes the total surplus of the economy."
