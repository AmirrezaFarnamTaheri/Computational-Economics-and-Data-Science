    "### 1. The McCall Job Search Model\n",
    "\n",
    "The McCall model, first formulated by John McCall in 1970, is a foundational model of microeconomic job search. It elegantly captures the trade-off an unemployed individual faces: accept a known wage offer now, or reject it in the hope of receiving a better offer in the future, while foregoing income and incurring search costs. This decision-making process under uncertainty is a classic optimal stopping problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model's central prediction is that the worker's optimal policy is defined by a **reservation wage**, $w^*$. This is a threshold: any offer at or above $w^*$ is accepted, and any offer below it is rejected. The reservation wage is the precise value that makes the worker indifferent between the long-term value of accepting the job and the expected long-term value of continuing to search. It is the solution to the equation:\n",
    "$$ \\frac{w^*}{1-\\beta} = c + \\beta E[\\max(\\frac{w'}{1-\\beta}, \\frac{w^*}{1-\\beta})] $$\n",
    "where $c$ is the flow value of unemployment (benefits), $\\beta$ is the discount factor, and the expectation is over the distribution of future wage offers $w'$."

    "The model consists of a large number of identical workers and firms. The core components are:\n",
    "- **Matching Function:** $M(u, v) = m u^\\alpha v^{1-\\alpha}$ determines the total number of new jobs formed as a function of the mass of unemployed workers, `u`, and vacant jobs, `v`.\n",
    "- **Market Tightness:** $\\theta = v/u$ is the key indicator of labor market conditions.\n",
    "- **Job-finding rate for workers:** $p(\\theta) = M/u = m\\theta^{1-\\alpha}$.\n",
    "- **Vacancy-filling rate for firms:** $q(\\theta) = M/v = m\\theta^{-\\alpha}$.\n",
    "- **Value Functions:** The values for an unemployed worker ($U$), an employed worker ($W$), a vacant firm ($V$), and a filled job ($J$) are given by the following asset-pricing equations:\n",
    "  $$ rU = b + p(\\theta)(W - U) $$ \n",
    "  $$ rW = w + s(U - W) $$\n",
    "  $$ rV = -\\kappa + q(\\theta)(J - V) $$\n",
    "  $$ rJ = y - w + s(V - J) $$\n",
    "  where:\n",

    "    - $\\kappa$: The per-period cost for a firm to maintain an open vacancy.\n",
    "    - $y$: The productivity of a filled job.\n",
    "- **Wage Determination:** The wage is determined by Nash bargaining. The total surplus of a match is $S = (W-U) + J$. The worker receives a fraction $\\phi$ (their bargaining power) of this surplus, leading to the wage equation: $w = \\phi(y + \\kappa\\theta) + (1-\\phi)b$. Notice that the worker's wage depends on their outside option ($b$) and their share of the match surplus, which itself includes the firm's saved search costs ($\\kappa\\theta$ represents the expected cost to find a new worker)."

    "- **Firing Costs:** Introducing firing costs (which increase the cost of job separation, $s$) has ambiguous effects. While it may reduce separations, it also makes firms more hesitant to hire, potentially lowering vacancy creation.\n",
    "- **Matching Efficiency ($m$):** Policies that improve the matching process (e.g., better job boards, retraining programs) increase $m$, shifting the Beveridge curve inwards and leading to lower unemployment for any given level of vacancies."

    "\n",
    "The basic DMP model, while powerful, predicts a single wage for all identical workers, which is counter-factual. The **Burdett-Mortensen (1998)** model extends the search framework to include **on-the-job search**, meaning that employed workers can continue to search for better offers. This single, realistic assumption has a profound consequence: it generates a non-degenerate, equilibrium wage distribution, even with identical workers and firms.\n",
    "\n",
    "The intuition is that firms, knowing that their workers might be poached by a competing offer, must decide on an optimal wage-posting strategy. A low-wage firm will have its workers hired away more frequently than a high-wage firm. This tension creates a continuous distribution of wages where firms trade off lower wage costs against shorter job durations."

    "### 4. Assortative Matching\n",
    "The theory of **assortative matching**, pioneered by Gary Becker, addresses the question of *who matches with whom* when agents are heterogeneous. The key concept is **supermodularity**. If the production function $F(k,h)$ (where $k$ is firm productivity and $h$ is worker skill) is supermodular, meaning $\\frac{\\partial^2 F}{\\partial k \\partial h} > 0$, then the marginal product of skill is higher at more productive firms. This creates an incentive for **Positive Assortative Matching (PAM)**, where high-skill workers match with high-productivity firms, as this maximizes the total surplus of the economy."
