    "### Introduction: Beyond the Infinitely-Lived Agent\n",
    "\n",
    "The macroeconomic models studied thus far (RCK, RBC) rely on the powerful but abstract simplification of a single, infinitely-lived representative household. This abstraction omits a fundamental feature of economic life: the **life cycle**. Individuals are born, work, save for retirement, and eventually die. The economy at any point in time is a heterogeneous mix of overlapping generations, each at a different stage of life. The interactions between these generations‚Äîthe young saving while the old dissave‚Äîare crucial for understanding a host of major economic issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Overlapping Generations (OLG) models**, pioneered by Maurice Allais (1947), Paul Samuelson (1958), and Peter Diamond (1965), provide the canonical framework for studying these life-cycle dynamics. By replacing the infinite horizon of the representative agent with a finite, more realistic lifetime, these models build a bridge between microeconomic life-cycle theory and aggregate macroeconomic outcomes. This seemingly simple change has profound implications:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Failure of Ricardian Equivalence:** In OLG models, government debt is not neutral because its burden can be shifted to future, unborn generations.\n",
    "2.  **Possibility of Dynamic Inefficiency:** An OLG economy can over-accumulate capital, leading to a situation where a policy intervention like Social Security can create a Pareto improvement.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook develops the OLG model from its foundations to several advanced extensions, showing its power and flexibility."

    "#### 1.1 The Household's Problem and the Law of Motion\n",
    "The economy is populated by a series of overlapping generations who live for two periods (young and old). The young supply labor, consume, and save. The old do not work and consume their savings. The household's problem is to choose consumption in both periods ($c_1, c_2$) to maximize lifetime utility $U = u(c_1) + \\beta u(c_2)$ subject to their budget constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "This leads to a saving function $s_t = s(w_t, r_{t+1})$. The aggregate capital stock in $t+1$ is the total saving of the young in period $t$: $K_{t+1} = N_t s_t$. In per-worker terms, this gives the law of motion for capital per worker: $k_{t+1} = s(w_t, r_{t+1}) / (1+n)$. With competitive markets, factor prices equal marginal products, so $w_t = w(k_t)$ and $r_{t+1} = r(k_{t+1})$. This yields an implicit difference equation for capital:\n",

    "#### 1.2 Dynamic Inefficiency\n",
    "A striking and counter-intuitive result from OLG models is that the decentralized market equilibrium can be **dynamically inefficient**. This is a situation where the economy has accumulated *too much* capital, saving so much that it has pushed the marginal product of capital (the interest rate) below the economy's growth rate ($r^* < n$). The economy is investing in capital that has a lower rate of return than the natural growth of the system itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "In such a scenario, it is possible to make everyone better off‚Äîa Pareto improvement. The intuition is that a policy which forces the current young generation to save less (e.g., a mandatory social security tax that funds a transfer to the current old) will reduce the capital stock. This moves the economy from the inefficiently high $k^*$ back towards the **Golden Rule** level of capital ($k_{gold}$) which maximizes steady-state consumption. The initial old generation is better off (they receive a transfer), and all future generations are better off because they are born into an economy with a more efficient capital stock that can deliver higher consumption."

    "#### 2.1 Failure of Ricardian Equivalence in the OLG Model\n",
    "The **Ricardian Equivalence proposition**, named after David Ricardo and famously revived by Robert Barro, states that a government's choice between financing spending with debt or with taxes has no effect on consumption or national saving. The logic is that rational, forward-looking agents understand that government borrowing today is simply a promise of higher taxes in the future. To prepare for that future tax liability, they will save the entirety of any debt-financed tax cut. The timing of taxes doesn't matter, only their present value.\n",
    "\n",
    "This proposition **fails** in the standard OLG model. The key reason is the finite lifetime of the agents. If the government issues debt to give a tax cut to the current young generation, the debt will be repaid by taxes levied on generations that are not yet born. The current generation receives a windfall that they do not have to pay for. Since they are disconnected from the future taxpayers, they treat the tax cut as an increase in their lifetime wealth and increase their consumption. This raises aggregate demand and lowers national saving, meaning the policy is not neutral."

If parents care about their children's utility and are already planning to leave them a bequest, they will respond to a debt-financed tax cut by simply increasing their bequest to their children by the full amount of the future tax liability. The tax cut is fully saved, national saving is unchanged, and the policy is neutral. The family dynasty acts as a single, infinitely-lived agent."
