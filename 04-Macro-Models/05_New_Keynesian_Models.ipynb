    "\n",
    "While the RBC model provided a powerful, microfounded framework, its core assumption that business cycles are efficient responses to technology shocks struggled to explain several key empirical facts, particularly the observation that purely nominal variables (like the money supply) seemed to have significant real effects. The **New Keynesian (NK) model** emerged in the 1990s as a response. It represents the modern synthesis in macroeconomics, blending the methodological rigor of the RBC school with the core insights of the Keynesian tradition—namely, that market imperfections can lead to inefficient fluctuations that can be addressed by stabilization policy.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model retains the DSGE framework—complete with rational expectations and intertemporal optimization—but introduces a crucial friction: **nominal rigidities**. The most common form is **sticky prices**, where firms are assumed to be unable to change their prices instantly in response to shocks. This single, micro-founded friction is revolutionary. It breaks the neutrality of money and creates a coherent framework where monetary policy actions have real effects on output and employment in the short run."

    "For the model to have a unique, stable equilibrium, the central bank must adhere to the **Taylor Principle**, which requires $\\phi_\\pi > 1$. The intuition is crucial: if inflation rises by 1 percentage point, the central bank must raise the nominal interest rate by *more* than 1 percentage point. This ensures that the *real* interest rate ($r_t = i_t - E_t[\\pi_{t+1}]$) also rises, which is necessary to cool down the economy and bring inflation back to target. If the central bank were to raise the nominal rate by less than the increase in inflation ($\"phi\"_\\pi < 1$), the real rate would actually fall, stimulating the economy and leading to an explosive, self-fulfilling spiral of ever-increasing inflation."

How does this affect the slope of the Phillips curve, `kappa`, and the resulting dynamics of inflation and the output gap?\n",
