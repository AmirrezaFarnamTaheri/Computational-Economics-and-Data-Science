    "$$ E[g(X)] = \\int g(x) p(x) dx $$\n",

    "2.  **Importance Sampling:** You want to estimate the probability that a standard normal random variable $Z$ is greater than 5, i.e., $P(Z > 5)$. This is a rare event, so standard Monte Carlo is inefficient. Estimate this probability using importance sampling with an exponential distribution (shifted to start at 5) as your proposal. Compare the variance of your estimate to that of a standard MC estimate.\n",

Price this option using a Monte Carlo simulation, but improve its efficiency by using the stock price $S_T$ as a control variate. We know analytically that $E[e^{-rT}S_T] = S_0$. Compare the variance of the control variate estimate to a standard MC estimate.\n",
