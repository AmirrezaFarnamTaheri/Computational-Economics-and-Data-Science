    "Linear algebra is the fundamental language used to express, analyze, and solve the interconnected systems that define modern economics. While microeconomics often begins with the study of a single agent or market, macroeconomics and econometrics are fundamentally concerned with systems of equations. From the market-clearing conditions of a general equilibrium model to the vast datasets of empirical work, linear algebra provides the tools to reason about entire systems through the geometry of vectors and matrices, rather than getting lost in a sea of individual equations.\n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter provides a practical guide to the core concepts of linear algebra, focusing on geometric intuition and computational best practices. We will explore:\n",
    "*   **Vector Spaces and Subspaces:** The abstract structures that govern vectors.\n",
    "*   **The Four Fundamental Subspaces:** The cornerstone theorem linking a matrix's key spaces.\n",
    "*   **Matrices as Transformations:** Understanding matrices as functions that transform vector spaces.\n",

    "- **Foundation:** Linear algebra is built on the concepts of vector spaces, subspaces, basis, and dimension. The **Four Fundamental Subspaces** provide a complete picture of a matrix's action.\n",
    "- **Geometric Intuition:** Matrices are linear transformations that rotate, scale, and shear space. The determinant measures the change in volume, and eigenvalues/eigenvectors describe the directions that are unchanged by the transformation.\n",
    "- **Solving Systems:** The workhorse problem `Ax=b` should be solved with decomposition-based methods like `np.linalg.solve` (which uses LU) or `scipy.linalg.lu_solve` for repeated solves. **Never use `inv(A)`**.\n",
    "- **Numerical Stability:** The **condition number** is a vital diagnostic for the sensitivity of `Ax=b`. For OLS, this reveals multicollinearity. The **QR decomposition** provides the most numerically stable method for solving least-squares problems.\n",
    "- **Decompositions are Key:** Understanding LU, QR, Cholesky, Eigendecomposition, and SVD is crucial. Each reveals a different aspect of the matrix and is suited to different problems (solving systems, stability analysis, dimensionality reduction).\n",
    "- **Sparsity:** Real-world economic models often generate huge, sparse matrices. Using `scipy.sparse` is essential for memory and computational efficiency."

    "\n",
    "1.  **Proof of Eigenvalues:** Prove that the eigenvalues of a real, symmetric, idempotent matrix must be either 0 or 1.\n",
    "    - *Hint: Start with the definition $Px = \\lambda x$. Multiply both sides by $P$. Use the idempotent property $P^2=P$.*\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **QR Decomposition for OLS:** A more stable way to solve the OLS problem is to use QR decomposition on the design matrix $X$. If $X=QR$, the normal equations $(X^T X)\\beta = X^T y$ become $(R^T Q^T Q R)\\beta = R^T Q^T y$, which simplifies to $R\\beta = Q^T y$ since $Q^T Q = I$. This is an upper-triangular system that can be solved efficiently with back substitution.\n",
    "    - **Task:** Using the data from the condition number example, compute the QR decomposition of `X_high`. Then solve the system $R\\beta = Q^T y$ for $\\beta$ using `scipy.linalg.solve_triangular`. Compare your result to the standard `np.linalg.lstsq` solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **SVD for Image Compression:** A powerful application of low-rank approximation via SVD is image compression. An image can be represented as a matrix of pixel values. By taking the SVD of the image matrix and reconstructing it using only the top `k` singular values and vectors, we can achieve significant compression.\n",
    "    - **Task:** Load an image (e.g., from `scipy.datasets.face(gray=True)`). Compute its SVD. Write a function that reconstructs the image using only the top `k` singular values. Use Matplotlib to display the original image and several reconstructions with different values of `k` (e.g., 5, 20, 50) to see the trade-off between compression and image quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **Sparse Fixed Effects:** In panel data econometrics, fixed effects are often implemented by creating a large number of dummy variables, one for each individual or group. This results in a very large, very sparse design matrix. \n",
    "    - **Task:** Create a sparse matrix representing a design matrix with 100,000 observations and 10,000 individual fixed effects (so it's a 100,000 x 10,000 matrix). Each row should have exactly one '1' in one of the 10,000 columns. Compare the memory usage of this matrix when stored as a `scipy.sparse.csr_matrix` versus a dense NumPy array."
