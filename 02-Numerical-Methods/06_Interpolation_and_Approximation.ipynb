    "### Introduction: Solving Models by Filling in the Gaps\n",
    "\n",
    "In many economic models, particularly in dynamic programming, we cannot solve for the value function or policy function analytically. Instead, solving the Bellman equation via methods like value function iteration gives us the value of the function only at a discrete set of points on a state-space grid. To find the optimal action at a state that falls *between* these grid points, we need a way to accurately \"fill in the gaps.\" This is the core task of **interpolation** and **function approximation**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook introduces the robust, professional methods that form the backbone of modern computational economics. We will see how naive approaches can fail spectacularly and explore the two workhorse methods for high-quality approximation: **Chebyshev regression** and **cubic spline interpolation**. We will also explore methods for multi-dimensional and unstructured data, grounding our exploration in core economic applications."

    "#### 1.1 The Weierstrass Approximation Theorem\n",
    "Before attempting to approximate a function, we should ask: is a good approximation even possible? The **Weierstrass Approximation Theorem** provides the fundamental justification. It states that for any continuous function $f(x)$ defined on a closed interval $[a, b]$, there exists a sequence of polynomials that converges uniformly to $f(x)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In essence, the theorem guarantees that we can get arbitrarily close to any continuous function with a polynomial of a sufficiently high degree. This gives us the theoretical license to pursue polynomial approximation as a valid strategy. The challenge, as we will see, is how to construct this polynomial in a stable and efficient way."

    "#### 1.2 The Runge Phenomenon: A Cautionary Tale\n",
    "A natural first thought for approximating a function is to fit a single, high-degree polynomial that passes through all our known data points. This approach has a fatal flaw, first identified by Carl Runge. He showed that for many simple, well-behaved functions, as you increase the degree of the interpolating polynomial on *evenly-spaced nodes*, the approximation develops wild oscillations near the endpoints of the interval. This is known as the **Runge phenomenon**."

    "\n",
    "Chebyshev polynomials are part of a broader class of **orthogonal polynomials**. Two polynomials $P_n(x)$ and $P_m(x)$ are orthogonal with respect to a weight function $w(x)$ on an interval $[a, b]$ if their inner product is zero: $\\int_a^b P_n(x) P_m(x) w(x) dx = 0$ for $n \\ne m$. This orthogonality is analogous to the orthogonality of vectors. When we use the values of orthogonal polynomials as basis functions in a regression, the resulting system of equations is well-conditioned, leading to a stable and accurate fit. This is the foundation of **Chebyshev regression**."

With this choice of nodes, an $n$-point Gaussian quadrature rule can exactly integrate any polynomial of degree $2n-1$ or less. This is dramatically more accurate than a simple Riemann sum with the same number of function evaluations."

Plot the absolute error of the approximation as a function of the number of quadrature points `n` (from 1 to 10). What do you observe about the rate of convergence?\n",

You have evaluated this function on a coarse 10x10 grid for `p` in `[10, 40]` and `w` in `[5, 20]`.
