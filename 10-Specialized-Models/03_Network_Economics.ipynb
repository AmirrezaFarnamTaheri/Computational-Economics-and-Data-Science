    "## 1. The Economy as a Network: Concepts and Measures\n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter introduces **Network Economics**, a field that analyzes how the structure of connections between economic agents shapes their behavior and drives aggregate outcomes. Classical economic models often assume agents interact anonymously through a central market mechanism. Network economics relaxes this assumption, recognizing that in the real world, **connections matter**. Who you know determines your job opportunities; who you trade with defines your supply chain; and who you learn from shapes your beliefs.\n",
    "\n",
    "A network (or **graph**) is a collection of **nodes** (or vertices) and **edges** (or links) that connect pairs of nodes. This simple structure has a long intellectual history, dating back to Leonhard Euler's 1736 solution to the famous **Seven Bridges of K√∂nigsberg** problem, which is considered the first paper in graph theory. In economics, this framework is incredibly versatile:\n",
    "*   **Nodes:** Can represent individuals, firms, banks, or countries.\n",
    "*   **Edges:** Can represent friendships, trade relationships, loans, or supply links. Edges can be **undirected** (symmetric), **directed** (asymmetric), or **weighted** (representing connection strength)."

    "### Representing Networks: Adjacency Matrices\n",
    "\n",
    "While visualizations are intuitive, the computational workhorse of network analysis is the **adjacency matrix**, $\\mathbf{A}$. For a network with $N$ nodes, this is an $N \\times N$ matrix where the entry $A_{ij}$ is 1 if there is an edge from node $i$ to node $j$, and 0 otherwise. For weighted networks, $A_{ij}$ can store the weight of the edge.\n",
    "\n",
    "The adjacency matrix is more than a storage device; its mathematical properties reveal deep truths about the network. For instance, the entry $(i, j)$ of the matrix $\\mathbf{A}^k$ ($\\mathbf{A}$ raised to the power of $k$) gives the number of distinct paths of length $k$ from node $i$ to node $j$. The `networkx` library is the standard Python tool for creating and analyzing these network structures."

Understanding these archetypes helps us think about the mechanisms that might generate the networks we observe in the economy:\n",
    "- **Erdos-Renyi (ER) Random Graph:** Any two nodes are connected with a fixed probability `p`. This is a model of purely random interactions and serves as a crucial theoretical benchmark. Its degree distribution is Poisson-like.\n",
    "- **Watts-Strogatz (WS) Small-World Graph:** Starts with a regular ring lattice and rewires some edges. This captures two key features of real social networks: high clustering (friends of friends are also friends) and short average path lengths (\"six degrees of separation\").\n",
    "- **Barabasi-Albert (BA) Scale-Free Graph:** New nodes attach preferentially to existing nodes with high degree. This \"preferential attachment\" or \"rich get richer\" mechanism generates a power-law degree distribution with highly-connected \"hubs.\" This topology is common in trade, citation, and financial networks."

    "A major question in macroeconomics is whether microeconomic, firm-level shocks can cause aggregate business cycles. The traditional view was no; idiosyncratic shocks should average out in a large economy. However, **Acemoglu et al. (2012)** showed that in a world with input-output linkages (a production network), this is not true. Shocks to a few, highly central firms can propagate and create significant aggregate volatility.\n",

    "where $Z_i$ is productivity, $L_i$ is labor, and $Y_{ji}$ is the amount of goods from sector $j$ used by sector $i$. The coefficients $a_{ij}$ come from an input-output matrix. A negative shock to one sector's $Z_k$ will reduce its output, which then becomes a negative shock to all sectors that use goods from $k$ as an input, propagating through the economy."

    "This notebook surveyed the application of network theory to economics, a field that provides powerful tools for understanding how the structure of connections shapes outcomes.\n",
    "- **Network Topology Matters:** The structure of a network‚Äîwhether it is random, small-world, or scale-free‚Äîis a crucial determinant of its behavior.\n",
    "- **Centrality is Context-Dependent:** Different centrality measures (degree, betweenness, eigenvector) capture different notions of importance, and the relevant measure depends on the economic question being asked.\n",
    "- **Social Networks** govern the diffusion of information, beliefs, and behaviors, with phenomena like consensus and S-shaped adoption curves emerging from the network structure.\n",
    "- **Financial Networks** are a key channel for the propagation of shocks and systemic risk. The 'robust-yet-fragile' nature of scale-free networks makes them particularly vulnerable to the failure of central hubs.\n",
    "- **Production Networks** can amplify idiosyncratic, firm-level shocks into aggregate business cycle fluctuations, providing a micro-founded theory of macroeconomic volatility."

    "## 6. Exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Network Robustness to Random Failure:** In the financial contagion example, we simulated a targeted attack on a central node. Modify the code to simulate a **random failure** by selecting 5 nodes at random to fail initially. Run this simulation on both the random and the scale-free networks. Which network topology is more robust to random shocks? Explain why this finding, combined with the result from the targeted attack, demonstrates the \"robust-yet-fragile\" property of scale-free networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Consensus in the DeGroot Model:** Does the DeGroot model always lead to a single consensus belief? Create a network with two separate, unconnected components (e.g., using `G1 = nx.erdos_renyi_graph(25, 0.3)` and `G2 = nx.erdos_renyi_graph(25, 0.3)`, then `G = nx.disjoint_union(G1, G2)`). Run the DeGroot simulation on this disconnected network. What happens to the long-run beliefs? How might this simple model relate to the concept of echo chambers or political polarization in social networks?\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Strategic Network Formation:** In many economic contexts, the network structure itself is the result of strategic choices by agents. Research the foundational **Jackson-Wolinsky (1996)** model of strategic network formation. What is the key trade-off agents face when deciding whether to form a link? What is the difference between a socially efficient network and a pairwise stable network in their model, and why do they often not coincide?\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **Production Network Centrality:** In the production network model, the shock was applied to the node with the highest degree centrality. Would the aggregate impact be larger or smaller if the shock was instead applied to the node with the highest *betweenness* centrality? Modify the code to test this and explain the intuition for your result.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.  **Information Design:** Imagine you are a social planner who wants to maximize the speed of information diffusion in the threshold model. You can choose the initial 5 adopters. Which nodes would you choose to maximize the final number of adopters after 10 steps? (Hint: Think about which centrality measure would identify the best 'seeds')."
