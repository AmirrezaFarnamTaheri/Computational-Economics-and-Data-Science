    "\n",
    "Standard representative-agent models, like the Real Business Cycle (RBC) model, are powerful but make a critical simplifying assumption: all households are identical. This means the models cannot address fundamental questions about inequality, social mobility, or the distributional consequences of economic policy. Why do some people save so much more than others? What drives the vast inequality in wealth we observe empirically? How do government policies affect the rich and the poor differently?\n",
    "\n",
    "To answer these questions, we need **heterogeneous agent models**. These models are populated by a large number of households who differ in their income, wealth, age, or other characteristics. The key challenge in these models is that we can no longer simply analyze the behavior of a single representative agent; we must characterize the entire **distribution** of agents and how it evolves over time.\n",

    "This notebook develops, from the ground up, one of the most important and influential heterogeneous agent models in modern macroeconomics: the **Aiyagari (1994) model**. This model provides a laboratory for understanding **precautionary savings** and the determinants of wealth inequality."

    "Faced with the risk of a low-income realization and the inability to borrow, households have a powerful incentive to engage in **precautionary savings**: they build up a buffer stock of assets to self-insure against bad times.

    "\n",
    "The Aiyagari model was a landmark achievement in macroeconomics for several reasons:\n",
    "1.  **Quantifying Precautionary Savings:** It was the first widely-used general equilibrium model to formalize and quantify the precautionary savings motive. It showed that adding uninsurable income risk could significantly increase the aggregate savings rate, helping to explain why aggregate wealth is so high.\n",
    "2.  **Explaining Wealth Inequality:** The model generates a persistent, non-degenerate distribution of wealth from a model with ex-ante identical agents. The inequality arises endogenously from the history of income shocks each agent receives. This provides a powerful, disciplined laboratory for studying the sources of wealth inequality.\n",
    "3.  **A Methodological Bridge:** It provided a tractable framework that bridged the gap between simple representative-agent models and more complex, less disciplined agent-based models. It retains the rigor of general equilibrium and rational expectations while incorporating the crucial feature of agent heterogeneity.\n",
    "4.  **Foundation for Modern Macro:** The computational techniques developed to solve the Aiyagari model laid the foundation for the vast literature on heterogeneous agent macroeconomics that followed, including models with more realistic features like life-cycle dynamics, housing, and portfolio choice (HANK models)."

    "This notebook provided a complete walkthrough of the canonical Aiyagari (1994) heterogeneous agent model.\n",
    "- Heterogeneous agent models are necessary to study questions of inequality and distribution.\n",
    "- The Aiyagari model shows how **precautionary savings** in response to **uninsurable idiosyncratic risk** can generate a stationary distribution of wealth.\n",
    "- Solving these models requires a nested-loop algorithm: an **outer loop** searches for market-clearing prices, and an **inner loop** solves the household's optimization problem for a given set of prices.\n",
    "- The model's equilibrium is characterized by a savings policy function that shows households building a buffer stock of assets, and a skewed wealth distribution that, while a major improvement on representative-agent models, is still less concentrated than the wealth distribution seen in the data."

    "## 7. Exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **The Role of Patience:** The household's discount factor, $\\beta$, determines their patience. How does the equilibrium interest rate $r^*$ change if households become more patient (e.g., $\\beta=0.98$)? Re-solve the model and explain the economic intuition for why the aggregate capital supply curve shifts.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Increased Risk:** The persistence of the low-income state is governed by the transition probability $\\pi(y_L|y_L)$. How does the equilibrium change if this probability increases (e.g., to `y_trans = np.array([[0.7, 0.3], [0.3, 0.7]])`)? Does the equilibrium interest rate fall or rise? Why? What does this tell you about the power of the precautionary savings motive?\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **No Borrowing Constraint:** What happens to the model if we relax the borrowing constraint and allow `a_min = -2.0`? Try to solve the model. What problem do you encounter? (Hint: Think about households that receive the high income shock forever). What does this tell you about the importance of borrowing constraints in this class of models?\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **Incomplete vs. Complete Markets:** In the standard representative-agent neoclassical growth model, the equilibrium interest rate is determined solely by the condition $r = 1/\\beta - 1$. How does the equilibrium interest rate in the Aiyagari model compare to this \"complete markets\" benchmark? Is it higher or lower? What does the difference represent?\n",
    "\n",
    "5.  **Adding a Wealth Tax:** Augment the model to include a simple proportional wealth tax, $\\tau$, that is collected and then redistributed to all households as a lump-sum transfer, $T$. The household's budget constraint becomes $c_t + a_{t+1} = (1+r(1-\\tau))a_t + y_t + T$. Modify the code to solve for the new stationary equilibrium. How does a 1% wealth tax affect the Gini coefficient of the wealth distribution?"
