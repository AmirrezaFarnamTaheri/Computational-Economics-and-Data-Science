## Overview

This repository hosts a PhD-level course on modern computational methods in economics and data science. It is designed to be a comprehensive, self-contained resource for graduate students and researchers. The curriculum begins with a rigorous introduction to the mathematical foundations of economic theory and progresses to the computational frontier of economic research, including deep learning and causal machine learning.

The course takes a "code-first" approach, emphasizing the practical implementation of economic models and econometric techniques. Each notebook is a self-contained lesson, complete with theoretical explanations, historical context, mathematical derivations, and fully executable Python code.

## Course Philosophy

The curriculum is built on two core principles:

1.  **Foundations First**: The course begins with a detailed mathematical appendix that provides the rigorous underpinnings for the methods to follow. This ensures that students have a solid theoretical base before moving on to computational applications.
2.  **Define Once, Apply Everywhere**: Foundational concepts in programming, numerical methods, and econometrics are established in the early chapters. Subsequent chapters on applied macroeconomics, microeconomics, and finance then build upon these foundations, showing how the core tools are used in practice. This avoids repetition and creates a clear, logical learning path from theory to application.

## Getting Started

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <repository-name>
    ```
2.  **Set up the Conda environment:**
    The recommended way to set up the environment is using `conda` (or the faster `mamba`) and the provided `environment.yml` file. This ensures a reproducible environment with all necessary packages.
    ```bash
    # We recommend using the faster Mamba to create the environment
    mamba env create -f environment.yml
    # Or, if you don't have Mamba, use Conda
    # conda env create -f environment.yml
    ```
3.  **Activate the environment:**
    ```bash
    conda activate my-research-env
    ```
4.  **Launch Jupyter:**
    ```bash
    jupyter lab
    ```
