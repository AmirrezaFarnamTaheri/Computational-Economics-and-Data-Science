    "### Introduction: Why Sets Matter in Computational Economics\n",
    "\n",
    "A `set` is an unordered collection of **unique, hashable** elements. While lists store items in sequence and dictionaries store key-value pairs, sets are designed to efficiently test for membership and perform mathematical set operations like union, intersection, and difference. Their performance for these operations is exceptional, with an average time complexity of **O(1)** for additions, removals, and membership tests, thanks to their underlying hash map implementation (similar to dictionaries).\n",
    "\n",
    "In computational economics, sets are indispensable tools for a variety of tasks:\n",
    "- **Managing Unique Items:** Tracking the unique agents in a simulation, the set of variables in a model, or the unique countries in a panel dataset.\n",
    "- **Data Cleaning:** Quickly finding the unique values in a column of data to identify categories or check for anomalies.\n",
    "- **Relational Logic:** Comparing the features of different models or the parameters used in different policy scenarios.\n",
    "- **Graph and Network Algorithms:** Representing the nodes or edges in a network, such as a trade network between countries.\n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter explores the creation, manipulation, and performance characteristics of Python's `set` and its immutable counterpart, `frozenset`. We will emphasize the powerful mathematical operations that make sets a cornerstone of clear, efficient, and expressive data manipulation."

Power sets are fundamental in combinatorics and are used in economics to model all possible coalitions of agents or all possible combinations of features in a model.\n",

    "\n",
    "3.  **Analyze the Result:**\n",
    "    - Call your function with the `agents` set.\n",
    "    - Print the resulting power set.\n",
    "    - Verify that the number of subsets is correct. For a set with *n* elements, its power set has **2<sup>n</sup>** elements. For the `agents` set (n=3), you should have 2<sup>3</sup> = 8 subsets.\n\n",
    "**Economic Interpretation:** In cooperative game theory, the elements of the power set represent all possible **coalitions** that can form among the agents. The empty set is the trivial coalition with no members, and the full set is the \"grand coalition\" of all agents."
