    "\n",
    "A program is more than a static list of calculations; it is a dynamic process that must make decisions, repeat actions, and respond gracefully to unexpected situations. The constructs that govern this process are fundamental to programming. **Control flow** statements (`if`, `for`, `while`, `match`) direct the logical path of execution, forming the core of any algorithm. **Error handling** (`try...except`) provides the mechanism for building robust and resilient programs that can anticipate and manage failures without crashing.\n",
    "\n",
    "In computational economics, control flow directs everything from an agent's decision rule in a simulation to the iterative process of a numerical solver. Error handling is equally critical, ensuring that if a numerical routine fails to converge, a data file is missing, or an API call fails, the program can recover or terminate with a clear, informative message. This chapter covers the syntax and idiomatic application of these essential constructs, which form the verb structure of the Python language."

    "The `for` loop is Python's most common iteration construct. It works by iterating over the elements of any **iterable** object. An object is iterable if it implements the `__iter__` special method, which must return an **iterator** object. An iterator is an object that produces values one at a time, implementing the `__next__` method. When a `for` loop starts, it calls `iter(my_iterable)` to get an iterator, and then calls `next()` on that iterator repeatedly until a `StopIteration` exception is raised, which signals the end of the sequence. This process is visualized below.\n",

    "#### 3.4 Defining and Chaining Custom Exceptions\n",
    "For domain-specific problems, defining your own exception types is a best practice. This makes error handling more precise and program logic clearer. A custom exception is created by creating a class that inherits from a built-in exception, usually `Exception` or a more specific one like `ValueError`. For robust libraries, it is common to create a **custom exception hierarchy**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Economic Application:** A numerical solver might fail to converge. Raising a custom `ModelNotConvergedError`, which inherits from a base `SolverError`, is far more informative than a generic `RuntimeError`. This allows calling code to handle all solver errors (`except SolverError:`) or specific ones (`except ModelNotConvergedError:`) gracefully.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you catch a low-level exception and raise a more specific, high-level one, it's a best practice to use **exception chaining** (`raise NewException from old_exception`) to preserve the original traceback."

    "### 4. Structural Pattern Matching: The `match` Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Introduced in Python 3.10, the `match` statement brings the concept of **structural pattern matching**, common in functional languages, to Python. It is a powerful control flow tool that compares a value against a series of patterns and executes a block of code corresponding to the first successful match. It can be thought of as a super-powered `if/elif/else` chain that can also deconstruct objects as part of the matching process.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Economic Application:** Analyzing the structure of commands or results from a simulation. For example, a result could be a tuple like `('CONVERGED', 0.98)` or `('ERROR', 'Matrix Singular')`. A `match` statement can elegantly handle these different structures in a way that is much cleaner than nested `if` statements."

    "### 5. Exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Search with `for...else`:** Write a function `check_for_bubble(prices, threshold=1.5)` that iterates through a list of asset prices. If it finds a price that is more than `threshold` times the previous price, it should print a warning with the price and the index and `break`. If the loop completes without finding any such jump, the `else` block should print \"No price bubble detected.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Refactoring to EAFP:** The following code uses the LBYL style to get a configuration value. It first tries to access the value as a dictionary key, and if that fails, it tries to access it as an object attribute. Refactor this to use the more Pythonic EAFP style with a `try...except` block that handles both `KeyError` and `AttributeError`.\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    # LBYL Version to be refactored\n",
    "    class Config: pass\n",
    "    config_dict = {'value': 1}\n",
    "    config_obj = Config()\n",
    "    config_obj.value = 2\n",
    "\n",
    "    def get_config_value_lbyl(source, key, default=None):\n",
    "        if isinstance(source, dict) and key in source:\n",
    "            return source[key]\n",
    "        if hasattr(source, key):\n",
    "            return getattr(source, key)\n",
    "        return default\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Custom Data Validation Exception:** You are reading a data file that is supposed to contain country ISO codes, which must be exactly three capital letters. Create a custom exception `InvalidISOCodeError`. Write a function `validate_iso_codes(codes)` that iterates through a list of codes. If it encounters a code that does not meet the criteria (is not a string, is not length 3, is not all uppercase), it should `raise` your custom exception with an informative message. Wrap the call to your function in a `try...except` block that specifically catches `InvalidISOCodeError`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **Context Manager for Resource Cleanup:** Imagine a function `run_simulation()` that creates a temporary file to store results: `temp_file = open('sim_results.tmp', 'w')`. The simulation logic inside a `try` block might fail with an exception. Use a `finally` block to guarantee that `temp_file.close()` is always called and a message \"Temporary file closed.\" is printed, regardless of whether the simulation succeeded or failed. Then, refactor your solution to use a `with` statement, which is the idiomatic way to handle this.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.  **`itertools` for Parameter Grids:** Use `itertools.product` to create an iterator that yields all possible combinations of parameters for a grid search. The parameters are `alpha = [0.25, 0.3, 0.35]`, `beta = [0.95, 0.99]`, and `sigma = [1.5, 2.0]`. Write a `for` loop to iterate over the product and print each combination."
