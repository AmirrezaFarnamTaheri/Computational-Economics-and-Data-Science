    "# 15. Accessing Economic Data via APIs\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction: The Power of Programmatic Data Access\n",
    "\n",
    "In modern economic research, data is paramount. While manually downloading datasets from websites is feasible for small-scale projects, this approach quickly becomes inefficient, error-prone, and impossible to scale. The professional standard for acquiring up-to-date, reproducible data is through Application Programming Interfaces (APIs).\n",
    "\n",
    "An API is a structured interface that allows computer programs to communicate with each other. Major data providers like the Federal Reserve and the World Bank offer APIs that give us direct, programmatic access to their vast databases. Using an API offers several distinct advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Reproducibility:** Your data acquisition process is encoded in a script, making your research perfectly reproducible by others.\n",
    "2.  **Efficiency:** You can automate the process of downloading, updating, and merging hundreds of data series with just a few lines of code.\n",
    "3.  **Scale:** APIs allow you to query and retrieve datasets that are far too large to handle manually.\n",
    "4.  **Real-Time Access:** You can build applications and dashboards that always have access to the very latest data releases.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides a practical guide to using Python to access two of the most important data sources for economists:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED):** A comprehensive database of over 800,000 U.S. and international time series, maintained by the St. Louis Fed.\n",
    "*   **World Bank Open Data:** A massive collection of global development indicators covering demographics, economics, finance, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use dedicated Python libraries that act as \"wrappers\" for these APIs, making it simple to send requests and process the data."
