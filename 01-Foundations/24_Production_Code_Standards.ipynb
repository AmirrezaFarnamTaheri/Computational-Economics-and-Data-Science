    "\n",
    "**Key Advantages of Logging:**\n",
    "- **Different Severity Levels:** You can log messages at different levels (e.g., `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARNING`, `ERROR`, `CRITICAL`), allowing you to filter for important events.\n",
    "- **Configurability:** You can easily redirect log output to a file, the console, or a remote service without changing your code.\n",
    "- **Structured Information:** Logs can be configured to automatically include timestamps, the function name, and the line number where the event occurred, making debugging much easier."

    "    a.  Install dependencies from `environment.yml`.\n",
    "    b.  Run `pytest` to check for correctness.\n",
    "    c.  Run `pre-commit` hooks to check for style.\n",
    "    d.  (Optional) Build a Docker container for the application.\n",
    "3.  **CD Pipeline:**\n",
