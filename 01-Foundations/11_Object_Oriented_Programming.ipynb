    "### Introduction: The Challenge of Stateful Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "As computational models in economics—especially simulations like agent-based models (ABMs) or dynamic structural models—grow in scale, we face a fundamental challenge: managing **stateful complexity**. A purely procedural approach, consisting of functions operating on a collection of global data structures (e.g., lists of wealth, dictionaries of parameters), quickly becomes tangled. A change in one function can have unforeseen side effects on the shared state, making the system difficult to reason about, test, and extend. This is akin to having a large workshop where all tools and parts are thrown into a single pile; finding what you need and ensuring it works correctly becomes a nightmare.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** is a paradigm designed specifically to solve this problem. It organizes code by bundling data (**attributes**) and the behavior that operates on that data (**methods**) into self-contained **objects**. This principle, known as **encapsulation**, creates logical, independent components that communicate through well-defined public interfaces. It's like organizing the workshop into labeled toolboxes, each containing specific tools (methods) and the parts they work on (attributes).\n",
    "\n",
    "For economists, OOP provides an intuitive and powerful way to structure models. We can represent a `Household` as an object with data like `wealth` and `labor_supply`, and methods like `consume()` and `save()`. A `Firm` can have `capital` and `technology` and a `produce()` method. A `Government` can have `tax_rate` and a `levy_taxes()` method. This approach allows us to build powerful abstractions that map directly onto the theoretical concepts we work with, leading to code that is more modular, robust, and intellectually coherent."

Instead, access should be controlled through a well-defined public interface (its methods).\n",

    "- **`__double_underscore`**: Triggers **name mangling**. An attribute like `__value` in class `MyClass` is renamed to `_MyClass__value`. This makes it harder (but not impossible) to access accidentally from outside, and is primarily used to avoid name clashes in inheritance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**`@property`**: The Pythonic way to provide managed access to attributes is with the `@property` decorator.

    "#### 2.2 Inheritance: Modeling 'is-a' Relationships\n",
    "**Inheritance** allows a new class (the **subclass** or child) to be created as a specialized version of an existing class (the **superclass** or parent). The subclass inherits all attributes and methods of the superclass. It can then add new functionality or **override** inherited methods to provide a more specialized behavior. Inheritance models an **\"is-a\"** relationship: a `DSGEModel` *is a* type of `EconomicModel`.\n",

    "The `super()` function is a crucial mechanism for building maintainable inheritance hierarchies. When you call `super().method()`, Python looks for `method` in the *next* class in the current class's **Method Resolution Order (MRO)**. This ensures that parent methods are called correctly and makes the code robust to changes in the inheritance structure (e.g., inserting a new base class into the hierarchy).\n",

    "In languages that support **multiple inheritance**, an ambiguity known as the \"diamond problem\" can arise.

If a method is called on an instance of `D` that is not defined in `D`, which parent's method should be used? Python solves this unambiguously using the **C3 linearization algorithm**, which computes a **Method Resolution Order (MRO)** for every class. You can inspect any class's MRO via its `__mro__` attribute or `.mro()` method.\n",

Subclasses must explicitly inherit from the ABC and implement its `@abstractmethod`s.

This is useful for frameworks where you want to strictly enforce that components adhere to a specific structure.\n",

    "2.  **Protocols (Static Duck Typing):** A Protocol (from the `typing` module, introduced in Python 3.8) defines an interface based on **structure**, not inheritance. Any class that has the right set of methods and signatures is considered to implement the protocol, without needing to inherit from it. This is checked by **static type checkers** (like Mypy) before you even run the code.

    "### 5. A Note on Performance: OOP vs. Data-Oriented Design\n",
    "\n",
    "While OOP is a powerful paradigm for managing logical complexity, it is not always the most performant approach for heavy numerical computation. The standard OOP approach involves creating many individual objects (e.g., a list of 1,000,000 `Household` objects). Iterating over this list in Python can be slow because each object is a separate entity in memory, leading to poor cache locality.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data-Oriented Design (DOD)** offers an alternative. Instead of a list of objects, you maintain a few large, contiguous arrays of data. For example, you would have one NumPy array for `wealth`, one for `income`, etc., where `wealth[i]` corresponds to the wealth of agent `i`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# OOP Style\n",
    "total_wealth = sum(agent.wealth for agent in agents)\n",
    "\n",
    "# DOD Style\n",
    "total_wealth = np.sum(agent_data['wealth'])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The DOD approach allows libraries like NumPy, Numba, and JAX to perform highly optimized, vectorized operations on the entire dataset at once, which is often orders of magnitude faster than a Python loop over objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The takeaway is to choose the right tool for the job:**\n",
    "- Use **OOP** to structure the high-level logic of your model, define components, manage configurations, and orchestrate the simulation.\n",
    "- Use **Data-Oriented Design** within performance-critical kernels of your model where you are performing repetitive numerical calculations on large datasets."

    "### 6. Exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Alternative Constructor with `@classmethod`**\n",
    "    - **Task:** Add a class method to the `Asset` class from Section 2.1 called `from_market_cap`. This method should accept `ticker`, `market_cap`, and `shares_outstanding` and should calculate the initial price internally to create and return a new `Asset` instance. Demonstrate its use.\n\n",
    "2.  **OOP Design: \"is-a\" vs. \"has-a\"**: You are modeling a `Portfolio` which contains a collection of `Asset` objects. Should `Portfolio` inherit from `list`? Or should it be a separate object that *has* a list of assets as an attribute (e.g., `self.assets = []`)? Justify your choice using the \"is-a\" vs. \"has-a\" principle and explain why the alternative is a poor design. (Hint: Consider what would happen if someone called the `.sort()` method on your `Portfolio` if it inherited from `list`—what would that imply about the portfolio itself?)\n\n",
    "3.  **`attrs` with Validators:** Create an `attrs` class `AgentPreferences` with two attributes: `beta` (discount factor) and `gamma` (risk aversion). Use `attrs` validators to ensure that `beta` is always between 0 and 1 (inclusive of 0, exclusive of 1) and `gamma` is always positive. Demonstrate that creating an instance with invalid parameters raises a `ValueError`.\n\n",
    "4.  **The Strategy Pattern for Consumption:** A `Household` agent needs to decide how much to consume out of their wealth. This decision can follow different rules (strategies).\n",
    "    - **Task:** Define a `ConsumptionStrategy` protocol with a method `decide_consumption(wealth: float) -> float`. Implement two strategies: `FixedFractionStrategy` which consumes a fixed fraction of wealth (e.g., 20%), and `TargetWealthStrategy` which consumes wealth above a certain target level.\n",
    "    - Create a `Household` class that is initialized with a consumption strategy object. Demonstrate that you can create two households with different strategies and that they behave differently when you call a `consume()` method on them.\n\n",
    "5.  **Combining Composition and Protocols:** Create an `attrs` class named `Market` that is composed of a `list` of `Household` objects and a `PricingModel` object. Define a `PricingModel` protocol with a method `find_equilibrium_price(households: List[Household]) -> float`. Implement a simple `AverageDemandPricer` that fulfills this protocol. The `Market` class should have a method `clear_market()` that uses its pricing model to calculate and print the equilibrium price."
