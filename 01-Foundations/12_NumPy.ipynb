It provides a high-performance, multidimensional array object (`ndarray`) and a vast library of tools for working with these arrays. It forms the core of the **Python Scientific Stack**, a collection of essential libraries for data analysis and modeling that also includes `SciPy` (for common scientific operations), `pandas` (for data manipulation), and `Matplotlib` (for plotting).\n",

    "The reason for NumPy's centrality is its stunning performance. Operations on NumPy arrays are orders of magnitude faster than equivalent operations on native Python lists. This is not a minor optimization; it is a fundamental capability that makes Python viable for computationally intensive work. This performance stems from its core data structure, the `ndarray`, which allows NumPy to execute highly optimized, pre-compiled C and Fortran code under the hood—a concept known as **vectorization**."

    "#### 6.1 `einsum`: The Language of Tensors\n",
    "`np.einsum` (Einstein summation) is a powerful and expressive function for performing complex array operations like transposing, multiplying, and summing over axes. It uses a string-based mini-language to define the operation. For example, a matrix-vector product `C = A @ B` can be written as `np.einsum('ij,j->i', A, B)`. This reads as \"Matrix A has indices `i` and `j`, vector B has index `j`. The common index `j` is summed over, leaving index `i` for the output.\"\n",

    "1.  **Views vs. Copies:** Create a 10x10 array of zeros. Create a view `A` of the inner 8x8 block and a copy `B` of the same block. Set all elements of `A` to 1 and all elements of `B` to 2. Print the original array. What do you observe and why?\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Broadcasting for Standardization:** Write a function `standardize(X)` that takes a 2D NumPy array `X` and returns a new array where each column has been standardized (subtract the column mean, divide by the column standard deviation). Do this using broadcasting, without any explicit loops. (Hint: `X.mean(axis=0)` will give you the column means as a 1D array, which will broadcast correctly).\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Filtering with Boolean and Fancy Indexing:** Using the economic `data` array from section 3.1, perform the following in a single line of code: Select the `Country_ID` and `Inflation` columns for all countries that are **not** in a recession (i.e., GDP growth is non-negative).\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **OLS from Scratch vs. Solver:** Using the OLS data from section 5.1, calculate the $\\hat{\\beta}$ vector manually using `linalg.inv`. Now, use `linalg.solve(X.T @ X, X.T @ y)` to solve the same system. Compare the results. `linalg.solve` is generally preferred over `linalg.inv` for solving systems of linear equations of the form $Ax=b$. Why might this be the case?\n",
    "\n",
    "5.  **Random Walk Simulation:** Use the modern `np.random.default_rng()` generator to simulate and plot 20 distinct random walks, each of 1000 steps. \n",
    "    - Create a 2D array of shape `(1000, 20)` with random steps (e.g., from a standard normal distribution).\n",
    "    - Compute the cumulative sum along the `axis=0` to get the paths of the 20 walks.\n",
    "    - Use Matplotlib's `plt.plot()` to plot all 20 walks on a single graph.\n\n",
    "6.  **`einsum` for Quadratic Form:** A quadratic form is a common expression in economics, written as $x^T A x$. \n",
    "    - **Task:** Create a random 5x5 matrix `A` and a random vector `x` of size 5. Compute the quadratic form in two ways: first using `@` for matrix multiplication, and second using `np.einsum`. Verify that the results are identical. What is the `einsum` string for this operation?"

    "Writing code that is correct is the first priority. Writing code that is *fast* is often a close second, especially in computational economics where simulations can take hours or even days. **Profiling** is the process of systematically measuring the resource usage of your code—identifying where it spends the most time and consumes the most memory. It is the essential first step to any optimization effort.\n",

    "A common mistake is to engage in **premature optimization**—guessing where the bottlenecks are and making code more complex in an attempt to speed it up, without any data.
