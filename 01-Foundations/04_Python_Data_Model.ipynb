    "### Introduction: Why Economists Should Care About Python's 'Grammar'\n",
    "\n",
    "Python's distinctive character—often described as \"Pythonic\"—is not an accident of syntax but the result of a deliberate design philosophy centered on consistency and readability. This philosophy is implemented through the **Python data model**, a formal specification that acts as a bridge between the language's core syntax and the objects you create and use. It is, in essence, the grammar of Python objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data model provides a set of protocols that allow user-defined objects to integrate seamlessly with the language's most natural idioms. It is the reason `len(my_collection)` is the universal way to get the size of any collection, from a built-in `list` to a complex `pandas.DataFrame`, rather than a class-specific method like `my_collection.length()`. It is the mechanism that allows the `+` operator to signify integer addition, string concatenation, and vector addition for a NumPy array. This is achieved by mapping the language's syntax to a set of special methods, often called \"dunder\" (double-underscore) methods, that you implement in your classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the Python interpreter encounters an operation like `len(obj)` or `obj1 + obj2`, it does not look for a method named `len` or `add`. Instead, it translates the operation into a call to a special method on the object itself: `obj.__len__()` or `obj1.__add__(obj2)`. By implementing these methods, you are effectively teaching Python's grammar to your custom objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a computational economist, mastering the data model is a practical necessity. It is the key to creating powerful, domain-specific types—a `PolicyVector`, a `ValueFunction`, a `TransitionMatrix`—that are as intuitive, robust, and easy to use as Python's built-in types. This leads to code that is more readable, less error-prone, and ultimately more scientifically credible. It is the difference between writing a script that works and engineering a tool that is a pleasure to use."

    "\n",
    "The **descriptor protocol** is one of Python's most powerful, yet often hidden, features. It is the core mechanism that underpins properties (`@property`), methods, class methods (`@classmethod`), and static methods (`@staticmethod`). A descriptor is an object attribute whose access behavior is controlled by methods in the descriptor's class. It allows you to intercept attribute access and run custom logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "A class becomes a descriptor if it implements any of these methods:\n",
    "- `__get__(self, instance, owner)`: Controls how the attribute's value is retrieved.\n",

    "- `__delete__(self, instance)`: Controls how the attribute is deleted.\n",
    "\n",
    "A descriptor is assigned as a *class attribute*. When you then access that attribute on an *instance* of the class, Python's lookup mechanism finds the descriptor on the class and invokes the appropriate special method, as illustrated below. This interception is a powerful pattern for creating self-validating data structures, a common need in economic modeling where parameters must often conform to certain constraints (e.g., a savings rate must be between 0 and 1). By encapsulating validation logic in a descriptor, you create a reusable component that can be applied across many different models and attributes. This is superior to validation in `__init__` because it protects the attribute's integrity throughout the object's entire lifecycle, not just at creation.\n",

    "\n",
    "Python provides a hook for intercepting access to attributes that do not otherwise exist in an object.\n",
    "\n",
    "`__getattr__(self, name)` is a **fallback method**. It is only called when a requested attribute `name` is **not found** through the standard mechanisms (i.e., not in the instance's `__dict__`, its class, or any parent classes). This makes it ideal for patterns like lazy loading or creating proxy objects, where you want to compute or fetch a value only when it is first requested.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Warning: `__getattr__` vs. `__getattribute__`**\n",
    "> Do not confuse `__getattr__` with `__getattribute__`. The latter is called for *every* attribute access, regardless of whether it exists or not. Overriding `__getattribute__` is difficult to do correctly without causing infinite recursion (e.g., by accessing `self.name` inside `__getattribute__`, which then calls `__getattribute__` again). It is a much more powerful tool but should be avoided unless absolutely necessary. For almost all use cases, `__getattr__` is the safer and more appropriate choice.\n",

    "    - **Task:** Create a simple `MutablePoint` class that stores its `x` and `y` coordinates in a `list`. Implement `__eq__` and `__hash__` based on the list's contents. Create an instance `p1 = MutablePoint([1, 2])`. Add `p1` to a set. Then, mutate `p1` by changing its list in-place (e.g., `p1.coords[0] = 10`). \n",
    "    - **Analysis:** Show that `p1` is now in a corrupted state within the set (i.e., you can't retrieve it, and `p1 in my_set` may give inconsistent results). Explain why this demonstrates that only immutable objects should be hashable.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Advanced Descriptor: `BoundedParameter`**\n",
    "    - **Task:** Create a descriptor class `BoundedParameter`. Its constructor should accept `min_value` and `max_value`. The descriptor's `__set__` method should enforce that any value assigned to the attribute falls within this inclusive range, raising a `ValueError` otherwise.\n",
    "    - **Application:** Demonstrate its use on a `GrowthModel` class with attributes like `beta = BoundedParameter(0.9, 0.99)` and `alpha = BoundedParameter(0.1, 0.5)` to ensure model parameters are always economically sensible.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Context Manager with Decorator**\n",
    "    - **Task:** Re-implement the `SeededRun` context manager from the previous exercise, but this time use the `@contextmanager` decorator from the `contextlib` module instead of a class.\n",
    "    - **Hint:** The function should `yield` after setting the new seed, and the `finally` block should restore the old state.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **Abstract Base Class for Solvers**\n",
    "    - **Task:** Create an ABC named `NumericalSolver` with an abstract method `solve(initial_guess)`. Then, create two concrete subclasses, `NewtonSolver` and `BisectionSolver`, that inherit from `NumericalSolver` and provide their own implementations of the `solve` method (they can just be print statements for this exercise). \n",
