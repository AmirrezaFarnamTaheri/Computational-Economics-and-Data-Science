    "1.  **Data**: The dataset being plotted.\n",
    "2.  **Aesthetics (Mappings)**: A mapping from data columns to visual properties. This is the heart of the grammar. Example: `map GDP to the x-axis`, `map Life Expectancy to the y-axis`, `map Continent to color`.\n",
    "3.  **Geometric Objects (Geoms)**: The shapes used to represent data (e.g., `points`, `lines`, `bars`).\n",
    "4.  **Statistical Transformations (Stats)**: Optional transformations of the data before plotting (e.g., `binning` for a histogram, `smoothing` for a regression line).\n",
    "5.  **Scales**: How data values are translated to visual properties (e.g., a linear or log scale for an axis).\n",
    "6.  **Coordinates**: The coordinate system used (e.g., Cartesian, polar).\n",
    "7.  **Faceting**: How to create subplots based on a categorical variable (e.g., creating a separate plot for each country).\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Seaborn (High-Level Declarative):** Built on Matplotlib, Seaborn provides a high-level interface for creating beautiful and informative **statistical graphics** (e.g., violin plots, heatmaps, regression plots) with very little code. It's excellent for exploration and for plots with a statistical focus.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Altair (Strictly Declarative):** A strict implementation of the Grammar of Graphics. Its key strength is producing **interactive charts** (zooming, panning, filtering) with a clean, JSON-based specification. It's ideal for web-based dashboards and exploratory analysis where interactivity is key.\n",

Customize the plots with titles, labels, and colors to make them publication-ready.\n",

    "5.  **Choosing the Right Plot:** You have a dataset of monthly unemployment rates for all 50 U.S. states over the last 20 years. You want to create a visualization that shows both the overall trend in unemployment for the entire country and highlights which states have unusually high or low unemployment in any given month. Describe what kind of plot or combination of plots you would create and which library you would use to do it. Justify your choices."
