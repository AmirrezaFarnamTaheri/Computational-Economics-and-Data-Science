    "### Introduction: Sequences, Mutability, and Semantic Meaning\n",
    "\n",
    "Economic analysis is fundamentally concerned with ordered data: time series of asset prices, panel data observations for a set of individuals, or a sequence of policy actions. Python's primary built-in tools for managing such ordered data are its **sequence types**, with the `list` and `tuple` being the most fundamental.\n",
    "\n",
    "The crucial technical distinction between them is **mutability**: a `list` is mutable (its contents and size can be changed after creation), while a `tuple` is immutable. However, this technical difference reflects a deeper semantic distinction that should guide their proper use. The choice between a `list` and a `tuple` is a design decision that communicates intent to the reader of your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Lists: A Collection of Peers.** A list is best understood as a container for a **homogeneous sequence**, where the items are of the same conceptual type and the number of items is arbitrary and may vary. The defining characteristic is that each element is a peer of the others. Examples include a series of stock returns `[0.01, -0.02, 0.005]`, a collection of agent objects in a simulation, or a list of country names `['USA', 'DEU', 'JPN']`. The list's mutability is a key feature, allowing you to add, remove, or reorder these peers as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Tuples: A Composite Record.** A tuple is best understood as a single, **heterogeneous record**, where each position has a specific, implicit meaning and the structure is fixed. The items may be of different types, and their order is a crucial part of the record's definition. Think of a tuple as a single row from a spreadsheet or a single observation from a dataset: `(agent_id, wealth, age)` or `(country_code, year, gdp_growth)`. Its immutability is a key feature, ensuring the integrity and atomicity of the record. You wouldn't want to accidentally delete the `year` from that observation.\n",
    "\n",
    "This semantic distinction has practical consequences for API design. Consider a function to calculate portfolio returns:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def calculate_portfolio_return(assets: List[Tuple[str, float, float]]) -> float:\n",
    "    # ... implementation ...\n",
    "```\n",
    "The type hint `List[Tuple[str, float, float]]` immediately communicates a wealth of information. It tells the user the function expects a **list** of assets, meaning it can handle any number of them. It also specifies that each individual asset should be represented as a **tuple**â€”a fixed record containing a ticker (string), a weight (float), and a return (float). This is far more expressive and less error-prone than simply hinting `List[Any]`. Choosing the right data structure is not just a technicality; it is a way of conveying intent. Understanding this distinction, and the performance characteristics of the underlying data structures, is essential for writing clear, correct, and efficient code."

    "A `list` is a mutable, ordered collection of items. Its flexibility makes it a workhorse for tasks where the size of the collection is not known beforehand or needs to change during execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.1 List Internals and Performance Characteristics\n",
    "Understanding the performance characteristics of list methods is critical for writing efficient code. A Python list is implemented as a **dynamic array**. This means it is a contiguous block of memory that holds an array of references (pointers) to the objects it contains. This design has direct consequences:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Fast Indexing:** Accessing an element by index (e.g., `my_list[i]`) is very fast, an O(1) operation, because the memory location can be calculated directly from the base address and the index.\n",
    "- **Fast Appending:** `my_list.append(x)` is also very fast, with an **amortized** O(1) time complexity. To avoid having to resize the array for every single append, Python's lists use a strategy of **overallocation**. When the list needs to grow, it allocates a new block of memory that is larger than immediately necessary. This new space can accommodate several future appends before another resize is needed. While a single append might occasionally trigger a costly O(n) resize-and-copy operation, the average cost over many appends is constant.\n",
    "- **Slow Insertion/Deletion at the Front:** `my_list.insert(0, x)` and `my_list.pop(0)` are slow, O(n) operations. To insert an item at the beginning, all existing elements in the array must be shifted one position to the right. Similarly, popping from the front requires shifting all remaining elements to the left. \n",
    "\n",
    "> **Performance Guideline:** For sequences that require frequent additions or removals from *both* ends (a common pattern in queueing simulations or graph algorithms), a `collections.deque` is a much more performant choice than a `list`."

    "#### 1.4 Advanced Sorting\n",

    "- `my_list.sort()`: Sorts the list **in-place** (it modifies the original list) and returns `None`.\n",
    "- `sorted(my_list)`: Returns a **new, sorted list**, leaving the original list unchanged.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The `key` Argument:** The power of Python's sorting lies in the `key` argument. This argument accepts a function that is called on each element to produce a comparison key. For simple cases, a `lambda` function is convenient. For sorting objects by attribute or items by index, `operator.itemgetter` and `operator.attrgetter` are often more readable and performant.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sort Stability:** Python's sort is **stable**. This means that if multiple records have the same comparison key, their original relative order is preserved in the sorted output. This is a powerful feature that allows for building up complex sorts by applying multiple sorting passes in sequence. For example, to sort a list of agents first by wealth (descending) and then by age (ascending for ties in wealth), you can perform two sorts: first, sort by the secondary key (age, ascending), and then sort that result by the primary key (wealth, descending). Because the second sort is stable, it will not disturb the relative order of agents who have the same wealth, preserving the age-based ordering established in the first pass."

It recursively traverses the original object and creates new copies of all objects it finds, no matter how deeply they are nested. This is the safest way to ensure that two complex, nested objects are completely decoupled."
