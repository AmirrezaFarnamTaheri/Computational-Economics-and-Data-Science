    "A primary challenge in teaching computational courses is providing timely, consistent, and high-quality feedback. Manual grading is slow, prone to bias, and logistically overwhelming, especially in large courses. **Otter-Grader** is a powerful open-source framework designed to solve this problem by automating the entire lifecycle of a computational assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Otter transforms grading into a pedagogical tool that enables:\n",
    "- **Immediate Formative Feedback:** Students can check their work against public tests as they go.\n",
    "- **Consistency and Fairness:** All submissions are evaluated against the same tests in the same environment.\n",
    "- **Scalability:** It allows a small instructional team to support hundreds or thousands of students.\n",
    "- **Richer Assignments:** By automating routine checks, instructors can focus on designing more creative problems and providing feedback on open-ended questions."
