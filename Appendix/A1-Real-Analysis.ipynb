This makes it incredibly powerful for proving that an equilibrium exists, even if we cannot guarantee that the equilibrium is unique or provide a simple algorithm to find it. Its most celebrated application is in game theory, where it is used to prove that every finite game has at least one Nash Equilibrium in mixed strategies."
