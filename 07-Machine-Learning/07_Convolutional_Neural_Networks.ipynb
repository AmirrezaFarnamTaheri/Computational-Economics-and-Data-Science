    "## 1. Introduction: The Power of Hierarchy and Invariance\n",
    "\n",
    "Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a specialized type of neural network designed to process data with a grid-like topology, such as images. Their architecture is inspired by the organization of the animal visual cortex and is designed to automatically and adaptively learn spatial hierarchies of features.\n",
    "\n",
    "The core strength of CNNs lies in two key properties:\n",
    "- **Locality:** They start by learning small, local patterns (like edges and corners).\n",
    "- **Hierarchy:** Subsequent layers combine these smaller patterns into larger, more complex ones (like shapes, textures, and eventually objects).\n",
    "- **Translation Invariance:** A pattern learned in one part of an image can be recognized in any other part. This makes the model extremely efficient, as it doesn't need to re-learn the same feature for different locations."

    "### 2.1 The Convolutional Layer\n",
    "\n",
    "The convolutional layer is the main building block of a CNN. It consists of a set of learnable filters (or kernels). Each filter is a small matrix of weights. The filter slides (convolves) over the input data, computing the dot product between the filter and the input at each position. This process creates a **feature map**, which highlights the locations where the filter's specific feature was detected.\n",

    "### 2.2 The Pooling Layer\n",
    "\n",
    "Pooling layers are used to downsample the feature maps, reducing their spatial dimensions. This has two main benefits:\n",
    "1.  **Reduces Computational Load:** Fewer parameters and computations are needed in subsequent layers.\n",
    "2.  **Increases Robustness:** By summarizing a neighborhood of features, it makes the model more robust to small shifts and distortions in the input.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common type of pooling is **Max Pooling**, which takes the maximum value from each small patch of the feature map."
