    "The **Multinomial Logit (MNL)** model arises from the assumption that the error terms $\\epsilon_{nj}$ are **independently and identically distributed (IID)** according to a **Type I Extreme Value (Gumbel)** distribution. The CDF of the Gumbel distribution is $F(\\epsilon) = \\exp(-e^{-\\epsilon})$.\n",

The ratio of probabilities for any two alternatives, $P_{ni}/P_{nk} = e^{V_{ni}}/e^{V_{nk}}$, depends only on the attributes of those two alternatives. This implies that introducing a new alternative reduces the probabilities of all existing alternatives proportionally. This is unrealistic in many settings (e.g., the \"red bus/blue bus\" problem), motivating more advanced models."

    "1.  **Demand Side:** A Mixed Logit model relates consumer choices to product characteristics (including price) and unobserved quality, $\\xi_j$. The model allows for heterogeneous consumer tastes.\n",
    "2.  **Supply Side:** Firms are assumed to set prices in a Bertrand-Nash equilibrium, where price is a function of marginal cost and the prices of competing products.\n",
    "3.  **Inversion:** The key insight is to use the model to *invert* the observed market shares to back out the unobserved product quality shocks, $\\xi_j$, that are consistent with the data.\n",
    "4.  **GMM Estimation:** The final step is a GMM estimation. The moment condition is that the unobserved quality shocks, $\\xi_j$, must be uncorrelated with the instrumental variables. Common instruments include the characteristics of *other* firms' products, which are correlated with price but plausibly uncorrelated with the unobserved quality of a specific product."

    "3.  **Simulation Bias:** The MSL estimator is consistent, but it is biased in finite samples because of the simulation noise. How does the bias of the MSL estimator depend on the number of simulation draws, `R`? \n",

    "4.  **Welfare Calculation:** The **log-sum-exp term**, $\\ln(\\sum_j e^{V_{nj}})$, represents the expected maximum utility an individual gets from their choice set. Use estimated MNL parameters to calculate the change in consumer welfare (in dollar terms) if the price of one alternative increases by 10%. (Hint: The marginal utility of income is the negative of the price coefficient).\n",
