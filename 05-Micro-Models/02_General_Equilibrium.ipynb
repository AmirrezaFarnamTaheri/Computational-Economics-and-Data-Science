    "\n",
    "The theory of **General Equilibrium (GE)**, pioneered by Léon Walras, provides the formal framework for analyzing the interdependencies of all markets in an economy. It addresses one of the oldest and most profound questions in economics: How can a decentralized market system, composed of millions of self-interested, independent agents, produce a coherent—and hopefully efficient—allocation of society's resources? \n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter explores the theoretical foundations of GE, its welfare implications, and its modern application in large-scale computational models.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will cover:\n",
    "1.  **The Arrow-Debreu Model:** A formal, abstract representation of a competitive economy.\n",
    "2.  **Existence of Equilibrium:** The conditions required for a competitive equilibrium to exist, and the role of fixed-point theorems.\n",
    "3.  **Welfare Theorems:** The formal link between competitive markets and Pareto efficiency.\n",

    "#### 1.1 Formalizing the Economy\n",
    "The Arrow-Debreu model provides the most general formulation of a competitive economy. Its key innovation is its definition of a **commodity** as a good distinguished by its physical properties, its location, and the **date and state of nature** at which it becomes available. A single price vector therefore specifies prices for all goods, in all places, at all times, and in all possible future states of the world.\n",

    "An **Arrow-Debreu equilibrium** consists of a price vector $\\mathbf{p}^*$ for all commodities and an allocation for every agent such that:\n",
    "1.  **Consumer Optimization:** Each consumer chooses their most preferred consumption bundle from their budget set.\n",
    "2.  **Firm Optimization:** Each firm chooses its production plan to maximize profits.\n",
    "3.  **Market Clearing:** The total demand for every commodity equals its total supply (from initial endowments and firm production)."

    "The proof of the existence of such an equilibrium, developed by Arrow, Debreu, and McKenzie, is a cornerstone of economic theory. It relies on **fixed-point theorems** applied to an **excess demand correspondence**, $Z(p)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key insight is to construct a continuous function that maps a set of prices to a new set of prices, raising the price of goods in excess demand and lowering the price of those in excess supply. A fixed point of this map is a price vector where no prices need to change, which can only occur if all markets are in equilibrium ($Z(p^*) = 0$). To guarantee the existence of such a fixed point, the proof requires certain technical conditions, most importantly that consumer preferences are **convex** and continuous, and that production technologies are convex."

    "2.  **Second Welfare Theorem:** Any Pareto efficient allocation can be supported as a competitive equilibrium after a suitable redistribution of initial endowments. This theorem provides a powerful (though controversial) justification for separating the goals of efficiency and equity: policy can focus on redistribution of endowments, and then let the market achieve an efficient outcome."

    "1.  **Stolper-Samuelson Theorem:** The Stolper-Samuelson theorem states that opening to trade (or imposing a tariff) will increase the real return to a country's relatively abundant factor and decrease the real return to its relatively scarce factor. In our Heckscher-Ohlin model, which factor is abundant in the Home country? When moving from autarky to free trade, does the real return to this factor (e.g., W/P_X) rise or fall?\n",
