    "\n",
    "In many economic relationships, one party has better information than another. This **asymmetric information** is a fundamental source of market friction. The **Principal-Agent framework** is the workhorse model economists use to analyze these situations.\n",
    "\n",
    "A principal-agent relationship exists whenever a **Principal** (e.g., an employer) hires an **Agent** (e.g., an employee) to perform a task on their behalf. The problem arises because their interests are not aligned, and the Principal cannot perfectly monitor the Agent. There are two main classes of information problems:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Moral Hazard (Hidden Action):** Arises *after* a contract is signed. The Principal cannot observe the Agent's actions (e.g., effort). The challenge is to design a contract that incentivizes the Agent to act in the Principal's interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Adverse Selection (Hidden Information):** Arises *before* a contract is signed. The Agent has private information about their own \"type\" (e.g., skill). The challenge is to design a menu of contracts that induces Agents to reveal their type through their choices."

It provides the *minimum* amount of incentive (and thus imposes the minimum amount of costly risk) needed to induce high effort."

This allows the Principal to rely less on direct, risky wage incentives in any single period, leading to better risk-sharing. This is the logic behind efficiency wages and career concerns."

    "1.  **The Informativeness Principle:** A manager's performance is measured by both accounting profits (noisy) and the firm's stock price (very noisy). How should the manager's bonus be structured? Should it depend more on profits or the stock price? Why?\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Limited Liability:** Re-solve the moral hazard model with a **limited liability** constraint that wages cannot be negative ($w_H, w_L \\ge 0$). How does this affect the optimal contract, especially when the agent is highly risk-averse?\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Adverse Selection in Insurance:** A health insurance company wants to offer policies to high-risk and low-risk customers. Use the logic of the screening model to describe the menu of contracts (premium and coverage level) the insurer should offer. Which type gets full insurance? Which type gets a contract with a high deductible?\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **Dynamic Moral Hazard:** Consider a two-period model where the agent can be fired after the first period. If the firm commits to firing the agent if output is low, but retaining them if output is high, how does this threat affect the wage spread ($w_H - w_L$) needed to incentivize effort in the first period compared to the static model?\n",
    "\n",
    "5.  **Optimal UI:** The Baily-Chetty formula shows that the optimal UI replacement rate depends on the elasticity of unemployment duration with respect to benefits, $\\epsilon_s$. If new empirical work finds this elasticity is larger than previously thought, should the optimal UI system become more or less generous? Explain."
