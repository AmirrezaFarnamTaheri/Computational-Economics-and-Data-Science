    "### Introduction: Game Theory Meets Computer Science\n",
    "\n",
    "Classical game theory provides a powerful framework for analyzing strategic interactions. However, it often abstracts away from the computational difficulties of its core concepts. For example, Nash's theorem proves that a mixed-strategy equilibrium *exists* in any finite game, but it doesn't provide an efficient recipe for *finding* it, especially in large games with many players or strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Algorithmic Game Theory** is a field at the intersection of economics and computer science that wrestles with these questions. It studies the computational aspects of strategic decision-making, focusing on:\n",
    "1.  **Computation of Equilibria:** Designing and analyzing the complexity of algorithms for finding equilibria.\n",
    "2.  **Mechanism Design:** The \"inverse\" problem of designing the rules of a game such that the strategic behavior of self-interested agents leads to a desirable outcome (e.g., maximizing social welfare or revenue).\n",
    "\n",
    "This field is the theoretical foundation for many of the largest and most innovative markets on the internet, including online advertising auctions (Google, Meta), ride-sharing platforms (Uber, Lyft), and kidney exchange markets."

    "### 1. The Complexity of Finding Nash Equilibria\n",
    "\n",
    "While finding a Nash equilibrium in a simple 2x2 game is straightforward, the problem's difficulty scales poorly. The premier algorithm for finding at least one Nash equilibrium in a two-player game is the **Lemke-Howson algorithm**, which works by traversing the vertices of a geometric representation of the game's payoffs. However, its worst-case performance is exponential in the number of strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "This computational hardness was formalized in a landmark 2009 paper by Daskalakis, Goldberg, and Papadimitriou, who showed that finding a Nash equilibrium is **PPAD-complete**. PPAD (Polynomial Parity Arguments on Directed graphs) is a complexity class that captures problems where a solution is guaranteed to exist by a specific kind of non-constructive argument (e.g., \"if a directed graph has an unbalanced node, it must have another one\"), but finding that solution may be intractable. For economists, the implication is profound: if finding a Nash equilibrium is computationally hard, it's less plausible to assume that real-world agents in complex strategic settings will be able to find and play such an equilibrium. This motivates the search for alternative, more tractable solution concepts."

    "### 1.1 Beyond Nash: Correlated Equilibrium\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the difficulty of computing and selecting among Nash equilibria, a more general and computationally tractable concept is the **Correlated Equilibrium (CE)**, introduced by Robert Aumann in 1974 (work for which he shared the 2005 Nobel Prize). The intuition is to introduce a trusted third party (a \"correlating device\" or a \"traffic light\") that privately recommends an action to each player. The recommendations are drawn from a joint probability distribution over all possible action profiles that is known to all players.\n",
    "\n",
    "A distribution is a Correlated Equilibrium if, for every player, assuming all other players follow their recommendations, it is optimal for that player to also follow their recommendation. This is a weaker solution concept than Nash (every Nash equilibrium is also a CE), but it has a crucial advantage: the set of correlated equilibria forms a convex polytope defined by a set of linear inequalities. This means we can find a CE by using **linear programming**, which is computationally efficient (solvable in polynomial time)."

    "The **Revelation Principle** is a foundational result in mechanism design.

This simplifies the design problem immensely: we can restrict our search to truthful mechanisms without loss of generality.\n",

This is the social opportunity cost, or negative externality, they impose on the rest of society.\n",

Agent $i$ pays the difference between the welfare others would have gotten without them, and the welfare they actually got with them: **Payment_i = $W_{-i}^*$ - (Welfare of others in the actual allocation)**.

    "1.  **Correlated vs. Nash:** For the \"Battle of the Sexes\" game, is the mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium also a correlated equilibrium? Show why or why not by checking if its probability distribution satisfies the incentive compatibility constraints for a CE. (Hint: A Nash equilibrium is always a CE, but it's useful to prove it for a specific case).\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **GSP and Truthfulness:** The GSP auction is not perfectly truthful. Using the simulation parameters from section 2.1, suppose Advertiser 1's true value per click is $3.00. Could they increase their profit by bidding something other than $2.50? (Profit = Clicks * (True Value - Price)). For simplicity, assume the number of clicks an ad in slot `k` gets is `100 / k`. Calculate Advertiser 1's profit with their current bid, and then see if they can do better by bidding, say, $1.90 to drop to a lower slot with a much lower price.\n",
    "    \n",
    "3.  **VCG Analysis:** In our VCG simulation, what would happen if Alice's valuation for the bundle 'XY' was only $13? Rerun the simulation by changing the `bidder_valuations` dictionary and explain the new allocation and payments. Why is VCG robust to such changes in valuations, and how does it always ensure the socially efficient outcome?\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **The Gale-Shapley Algorithm:** The **Gale-Shapley algorithm** (1962) provides a method for finding a stable matching in a two-sided market (e.g., medical residents to hospitals, students to schools). Research the algorithm. Is it guaranteed to find a unique stable matching? Is it strategy-proof (truthful) for all participants? Explain which side of the market has an incentive to be truthful.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.  **Algorithmic Fairness:** A growing area of concern is algorithmic fairness. In the context of the GSP auction, how might the use of a proprietary, black-box Quality Score lead to outcomes that are considered unfair or anti-competitive? For example, what if the Quality Score model inadvertently penalizes ads from new businesses or those using certain dialects of a language? What kind of data would you need to test for such biases?"
