    "Microeconomic theory is built upon the foundational pillars of consumer and producer theory. This chapter explores the deep, unifying concepts that underpin modern microeconomics:\n",
    "1.  **Duality:** We explore the elegant symmetry between maximization and minimization problems, deriving key results like the Slutsky equation and the **integrability** conditions that allow us to recover preferences from demand behavior.\n",
    "2.  **Revealed Preference:** We introduce a non-parametric, behavioral approach to consumer choice that does not require assuming a utility function.\n",
    "3.  **Labor Supply:** We apply the theory to model the crucial economic decision of how much to work.\n",
    "4.  **Choice Under Uncertainty:** We introduce the von Neumann-Morgenstern (vNM) expected utility framework, the foundation of modern finance and macroeconomics.\n",
    "5.  **General Equilibrium:** We use the Edgeworth Box to illustrate how the choices of individual agents aggregate and interact to determine market-clearing prices and allocations."
