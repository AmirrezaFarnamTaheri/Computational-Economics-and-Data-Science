    "In many economic relationships, one party has better information than another. This **asymmetric information** can cause markets to function poorly or even collapse entirely. The study of these problems, pioneered by Nobel laureates George Akerlof, Michael Spence, and Joseph Stiglitz, is a cornerstone of modern microeconomic theory.\n",

    "This chapter explores the market responses to **hidden information** (adverse selection), where one party has private information about their \"type.\"\n",

    "#### 1.1 Akerlof's Market for Lemons\n",
    "George Akerlof's (1970) model shows how adverse selection can destroy a market. When buyers cannot distinguish high-quality \"peaches\" from low-quality \"lemons,\" they will only offer a price based on the average quality in the market. If this average price is below the value at which peach-owners are willing to sell, high-quality goods will exit the market, leading to a collapse where only lemons are traded. This destroys the potential gains from trade for high-quality goods."

    "#### 2.1 The Spence Job-Market Model\n",
    "In Spence's (1973) model, education does not increase productivity. It serves purely as a **signal** of a worker's innate ability. The signal is credible because the cost of acquiring education is lower for high-ability workers. A **separating equilibrium** exists if high-ability workers choose to acquire a certain level of education $e^*$ and low-ability workers choose not to, and firms' beliefs are consistent with this. This requires two incentive compatibility constraints to hold:\n",
    "1.  **High-Ability ICC:** High-ability workers must prefer getting education for a high wage over getting no education for a low wage.\n",
    "2.  **Low-Ability ICC:** Low-ability workers must find it too costly to mimic the high-ability workers.\n",
    "These define a range of education levels that can support a separating equilibrium: $ e^* \\in [\\frac{w_H - w_L}{c_L}, \\frac{w_H - w_L}{c_H}] $."

    "#### 2.2 Perfect Bayesian Equilibrium and Refinements\n",
    "Signaling games are dynamic games of incomplete information. The appropriate solution concept is **Perfect Bayesian Equilibrium (PBE)**. A PBE consists of a set of strategies for all players and a set of beliefs for the uninformed player, such that:\n",
    "1.  **Sequential Rationality:** At every stage, each player's strategy is optimal given their beliefs.\n",
    "2.  **Belief Consistency:** Beliefs are updated from priors using Bayes' rule along the equilibrium path.\n",
    "\n",
    "A problem is that PBE places no restrictions on beliefs for *off-equilibrium* actions. This can lead to implausible equilibria. The **Intuitive Criterion** by Cho and Kreps (1987) is a **refinement** that rules out equilibria that are supported by unreasonable off-path beliefs. It argues that if an off-equilibrium action is taken, the uninformed player should not believe it was taken by a type who would have been worse off no matter how the receiver responded. In the Spence model, this refinement selects the most efficient separating equilibrium, where $e^*$ is at the lowest possible level that still deters low-ability types."

    "In a **screening** game, the *uninformed* party moves first, designing a menu of contracts to induce agents to reveal their hidden type. The canonical model is **Rothschild and Stiglitz (1976)** on competitive insurance markets.\n",
    "\n",
    "An insurer faces high-risk and low-risk customers but cannot tell them apart. If the insurer offers a single contract based on average risk, only high-risk types will buy it (adverse selection), and the insurer will make a loss. The only possible equilibrium is a separating one, where the insurer offers a menu of two contracts:\n",
    "1.  **Full Insurance for High-Risk:** A contract with full insurance, priced actuarially for high-risk types.\n",
    "2.  **Partial Insurance for Low-Risk:** A contract with only partial insurance (e.g., a high deductible), priced for low-risk types. The coverage must be distorted downwards just enough to make this contract unattractive to the high-risk types.\n",
    "\n",
    "A key finding is that even this separating equilibrium may not exist if there is a large enough fraction of low-risk people, as a rival insurer could profitably offer a different contract that breaks the equilibrium."

    "### 4. Application: Reputational Models\n",
    "**Reputational models** are dynamic games of incomplete information where a long-lived player's actions can build a reputation that influences the behavior of short-lived players. The classic example is **limit pricing** (Milgrom & Roberts, 1982), where an incumbent monopolist may fight an entrant (by starting a price war) even if it is costly in the short run. This action serves as a signal to *future* potential entrants that the incumbent is a \"tough\" or low-cost type, thereby deterring future entry and preserving long-run monopoly profits."

    "- **Team Production (Alchian & Demsetz, 1972):** When output is the result of a team's effort, it is hard to measure individual contributions. This creates a free-rider problem. The classical solution is to introduce a monitor (a manager) who specializes in observing inputs and has a claim to the firm's residual profits, giving them an incentive to ensure effort.\n",
    "- **The Ratchet Effect (Holmström, 1999):** In a dynamic setting, a manager might be hesitant to reveal high productivity today for fear that the principal will demand more (i.e., \"ratchet up\" the performance target) in the future without a corresponding increase in pay. This can lead to a sub-optimal suppression of effort and information."
