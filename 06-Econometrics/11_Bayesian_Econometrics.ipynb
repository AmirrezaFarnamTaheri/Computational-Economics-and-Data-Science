    "### Introduction: A Different Philosophy of Inference\n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter introduces a fundamentally different philosophy of statistical inference: **Bayesian Econometrics**. In contrast to the **Frequentist** approach, which underpins most of the methods seen so far (like OLS and MLE), the Bayesian paradigm treats model parameters not as fixed, unknown constants, but as random variables about which we can have beliefs and uncertainty.\n",
    "\n",
    "The philosophical divide between the two schools of thought can be summarized by what each considers to be random:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **Frequentist** approach views the **data as random** and the **parameters as fixed**. A parameter like a regression coefficient, $\\beta$, is a single, unknown constant of nature. We cannot make probability statements about $\\beta$ itself (e.g., \"there is a 95% probability that $\\beta$ is between 0.5 and 1.0\"). It either is or it isn't in that interval. Instead, we construct **confidence intervals**. A 95% confidence interval is a statement about the *procedure*: if we could repeat our experiment many times, drawing new random datasets each time, 95% of the intervals we construct would contain the true, fixed $\\beta$.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **Bayesian** approach views the **data as fixed** (it's what we observed) and the **parameters as random**. Probability is defined as a **degree of belief** or confidence in a proposition. It is perfectly natural to have a probability distribution over a parameter, representing our uncertainty about its true value. We start with an initial belief (the **prior**), and as we collect data, we update our beliefs in a principled way using **Bayes' Theorem**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach provides a powerful and intuitive framework for thinking about and communicating uncertainty. Its modern application has been unlocked by computational breakthroughs, particularly in **Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)** algorithms. These methods allow us to solve complex and high-dimensional problems that were computationally intractable for most of the 20th century, moving Bayesian analysis from a theoretical curiosity to a practical tool for empirical research."

    "## 1. The Core of the Bayesian Paradigm: Bayes' Theorem\n",
    "\n",
    "The engine of Bayesian inference is Bayes' Theorem, which provides a formal rule for updating our beliefs in light of new evidence.\n",
    "$$ \\underbrace{P(\\theta|D)}_{\\text{Posterior}} = \\frac{\\overbrace{P(D|\\theta)}^{\\text{Likelihood}} \\times \\overbrace{P(\\theta)}^{\\text{Prior}}}{\\underbrace{P(D)}_{\\text{Marginal Likelihood}}} $$ \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's break down the components in the context of econometric modeling:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Prior Distribution, $P(\\theta)$:** This distribution represents our beliefs about the parameter $\\theta$ *before* seeing the data. This is a powerful feature, as it allows us to formally incorporate existing knowledge or theory into our model. If we are largely ignorant or want the data to speak for itself, we can use a \"weak,\" \"diffuse,\" or \"uninformative\" prior that assigns roughly equal belief across a wide range of parameter values.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Likelihood, $P(D|\\theta)$:** This is the same likelihood function used in Maximum Likelihood Estimation. It specifies the data-generating process. It answers the question: \"If the true parameter value were $\\theta$, what is the probability of observing the data $D$ that we actually collected?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Posterior Distribution, $P(\\theta|D)$:** This is the primary output of a Bayesian analysis. It represents our updated beliefs about $\\theta$ *after* observing the data. The posterior is a principled compromise, a weighted average of the information contained in the prior and the information contained in the data (via the likelihood).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Marginal Likelihood, $P(D)$:** This term represents the probability of the data, averaged over all possible values of the parameters, weighted by our prior beliefs: $P(D) = \\int P(D|\\theta)P(\\theta) d\\theta$. This denominator acts as a normalizing constant, ensuring the posterior distribution integrates to 1. For parameter estimation, we can often ignore it, as the posterior is proportional to the numerator: **Posterior $\\propto$ Likelihood $\\times$ Prior**. However, the marginal likelihood (also called **model evidence**) is crucial for Bayesian model comparison."

    "Before modern computational methods became widespread, Bayesian analysis relied heavily on finding analytical solutions to the updating problem. This is possible in special cases where the **prior distribution is conjugate to the likelihood function**. A prior is conjugate if the resulting posterior distribution belongs to the same family of distributions as the prior.\n",
    "\n",
    "The classic example is the **Beta-Binomial model**. Suppose we are interested in the probability of success, $p$, in a series of Bernoulli trials. The likelihood of observing $k$ successes in $n$ trials is given by the Binomial distribution. If we choose a Beta distribution as our prior for the parameter $p$, the resulting posterior for $p$ is also a Beta distribution. This provides a simple, closed-form way to see how the data updates our beliefs.\n",

    "1.  **Prior Sensitivity Analysis:** The choice of prior can influence the posterior, especially with small datasets. Re-run the linear regression model from Section 4, but change the priors to be much more \"informative\" (narrower) and incorrect. For example, set `alpha = pm.Normal('alpha', mu=5, sigma=0.1)` and `beta = pm.Normal('beta', mu=-5, sigma=0.1)`. How do the posterior mean and credible intervals change compared to the original model? Now, increase the dataset size to `N=5000` and repeat the experiment with these incorrect, informative priors. What happens to the influence of the prior as the sample size grows? This demonstrates the concept of the data \"overwhelming\" the prior.\n",

    "2.  **Posterior Predictive Checks:** A key part of the Bayesian workflow is checking if your fitted model generates data that looks like the data you actually observed. This is a **posterior predictive check**. Using the original fitted model (`idata`), use `pm.sample_posterior_predictive` to generate simulated datasets from your fitted model's posterior distribution. Then, use `arviz.plot_ppc` to plot a histogram of the observed `y` and overlay it with histograms from several of your simulated datasets. Does the model capture the central tendency and spread of the data well?\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Bayesian Logistic Regression:** Use `PyMC` to build a Bayesian logistic regression model. First, generate synthetic data for a binary outcome. For example, create an `X` variable, define a probability `p = pm.math.sigmoid(alpha + beta * X)`, and then use `pm.Bernoulli` as the likelihood function to model a binary `y`. Fit the model and interpret the posterior for `beta`. How would you explain the meaning of the credible interval for `beta` in this context?\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **Hierarchical Models:** One of the most powerful applications of the Bayesian framework is in building **hierarchical (or multilevel) models**. These are models where parameters are themselves drawn from a distribution, which is perfect for modeling data with a group structure (e.g., students within schools, or firms within industries). Research the concept of **partial pooling** in hierarchical models. Explain why it is often superior to either complete pooling (ignoring the group structure and fitting one model) or no pooling (running a separate regression for each group)."
