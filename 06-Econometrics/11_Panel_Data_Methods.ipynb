    "\n",
    "**Panel data**, also known as longitudinal data, follows the same set of individuals (e.g., people, firms, countries) over multiple time periods. This data structure is incredibly powerful because it provides a solution to one of the most pervasive problems in econometrics: **omitted variable bias** arising from unobserved, time-invariant heterogeneity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider estimating the effect of education on wages. In a simple cross-section of individuals, we might worry that an unobserved factor like a person's innate \"ability\" or \"drive\" is correlated with both their education level and their future wages. Since we cannot measure ability, it becomes part of the error term, violating the OLS exogeneity assumption and biasing our estimate of the return to education.\n",
    "\n",
    "Panel data offers a powerful solution. By observing the same person over time, we can use econometric techniques to effectively difference out *all* time-invariant characteristics, whether observed or unobserved. This allows us to isolate the true effect of the variables that change over time, providing a much more credible path to causal inference.\n",

It captures all factors that are constant over time for a given individual, such as a firm's management quality, a person's innate ability, or a country's geography and institutions. This is the primary source of omitted variable bias if it's correlated with the regressors $\\mathbf{x}_{it}$.\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "2.  **Manual Within-Transformation:** To prove you understand the FE transformation, perform it by hand. Using the `grunfeld` dataset, use `pandas` to group the data by firm, calculate the firm-specific mean for `invest`, `value`, and `capital`, and then subtract these means from the original values to create new demeaned variables. Finally, run a simple OLS (using `smf.ols`) of demeaned `invest` on demeaned `value` and `capital`. Verify that the coefficients you get are identical to those from the `PanelOLS` Fixed Effects model.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **First-Differencing:** An alternative to the within-transformation for removing fixed effects is the **first-difference (FD) estimator**. This involves subtracting the equation at time `t-1` from the equation at time `t` for each individual.\n",
    "    a. Write down the first-differenced equation and show that the fixed effect $c_i$ is eliminated.\n",
    "    b. When might the FD estimator be preferred to the FE estimator? (Hint: Think about the assumptions on the idiosyncratic error term $u_{it}$. What if $u_{it}$ follows a random walk?)\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **Data Application:** Find a panel dataset of your choice (e.g., from the `piketty` R dataset collection, or a dataset from a previous course). Formulate a research question, estimate Pooled OLS, Fixed Effects (one-way and two-way), and Random Effects models. Perform a Hausman test to determine which model is most appropriate for your data and justify your choice."
