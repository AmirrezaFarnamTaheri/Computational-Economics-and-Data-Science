    "### Introduction: Isolating Exogenous Variation\n",
    "\n",
    "When a regressor $D$ is correlated with the error term $u$, we say it is **endogenous**. This is the central problem in empirical economics. The method of **Instrumental Variables (IV)** is a cornerstone of modern econometrics for estimating causal effects in the presence of endogeneity. The core idea is to find a third variable, the **instrument ($Z$)**, that isolates a source of exogenous variation in the endogenous variable. The instrument must satisfy two core conditions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Instrument Relevance:** The instrument must be a cause of the treatment ($Z \\rightarrow D$).\n",
    "2.  **The Exclusion Restriction:** The instrument must *only* affect the outcome through its effect on the treatment. It cannot have a direct effect on $Y$ or be correlated with any unobserved confounders.\n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter provides a PhD-level treatment of IV, covering its derivation, the LATE framework, and methods for dealing with common pitfalls like weak instruments."

    "### 1. The IV Estimator: Two-Stage Least Squares (2SLS)\n",
    "The most common IV estimator is **Two-Stage Least Squares (2SLS)**. It can be understood intuitively as a two-step procedure:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **First Stage:** We purge the endogenous variable $D$ of its correlation with the error term. We do this by regressing $D$ on the instrument $Z$ and any exogenous controls $X$. This gives us the predicted values, $\\hat{D}$. These predicted values represent the part of the variation in $D$ that is explained *only* by the exogenous variables.\n",
    "    $$ D = \\pi_0 + \\pi_1 Z + \\pi_2 X + v $$\n",
    "2.  **Second Stage:** We run the original regression, but replace the endogenous variable $D$ with its predicted value from the first stage, $\\hat{D}$.\n",
    "    $$ Y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\hat{D} + \\beta_2 X + u $$\n",
    "Because $\\hat{D}$ is, by construction, a linear combination of the exogenous variables, it is uncorrelated with the error term $u$, and this second-stage regression yields a consistent estimate of the causal effect $\\beta_1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important Note:** While this two-stage procedure is intuitive, one should **never run it manually**. The standard errors from the second-stage OLS are incorrect because they fail to account for the uncertainty in estimating the first stage. Always use specialized software (like `linearmodels` or `Stata`) that computes the correct 2SLS variance-covariance matrix."

    "3.  **Never-Takers:** People who never take the treatment, regardless of the instrument.\n",

How does the estimated treatment effect compare to the OLS and 2SLS estimates?\n",
