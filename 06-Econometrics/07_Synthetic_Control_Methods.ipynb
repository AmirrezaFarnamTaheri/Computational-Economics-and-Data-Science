    "## 1. The Counterfactual Problem in Case Studies\n",
    "\n",
    "A common challenge in economics and political science is to estimate the causal effect of a large-scale event or policy intervention on a single aggregate unit (e.g., a country, state, or city). For example:\n",
    "- What was the effect of German reunification on West Germany's GDP?\n",
    "- What was the impact of California's Proposition 99 (a tobacco tax) on smoking rates?\n",
    "\n",
    "The fundamental problem is that we only observe the outcome for the treated unit *after* the intervention. We do not observe the **counterfactual**: what would have happened to that same unit in the absence of the event? This is the core challenge of causal inference.\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional methods like Difference-in-Differences (DiD) rely on finding a single control unit or an average of control units that had a parallel trend with the treated unit before the intervention. But what if no single unit provides a good comparison? This is where the Synthetic Control Method comes in."

    "\n",
    "The Synthetic Control Method, developed by Abadie and Gardeazabal (2003) and Abadie, Diamond, and Hainmueller (2010), provides a systematic way to construct a better counterfactual. \n",
    "\n",
    "The core idea is to create a **\"synthetic\" control unit** by taking a weighted average of multiple untreated units (the \"donor pool\"). The weights are chosen algorithmically to create a synthetic unit that best matches the treated unit's characteristics *before* the intervention. \n",
    "\n",
    "This synthetic control then serves as the ideal counterfactual. The causal effect of the intervention is estimated as the difference between the outcome of the treated unit and the outcome of its synthetic counterpart after the intervention."

    "Suppose we have $J+1$ units. Unit 1 is the treated unit, and units $j=2, ..., J+1$ form the donor pool of potential controls. We want to find a set of weights $W = (w_2, ..., w_{J+1})'$ such that:\n",

    "- $\\sum_{j=2}^{J+1} w_j = 1$ (weights sum to one)\n",
    "\n",
    "The weights are chosen to minimize the distance between the pre-treatment characteristics of the treated unit and the synthetic control. Let $X_1$ be a vector of pre-treatment characteristics for the treated unit, and $X_0$ be a matrix containing the same characteristics for the units in the donor pool. The optimization problem is:\n",
    "$$ \\min_{W} || X_1 - X_0 W ||_V = \\sqrt{(X_1 - X_0 W)' V (X_1 - X_0 W)} $$\n",
    "where $V$ is a weighting matrix that reflects the relative importance of the different pre-treatment characteristics. The choice of $V$ is crucial and is often chosen to minimize the mean squared prediction error of the outcome variable in the pre-treatment period."

    "**Limitations:**\n",
    "- **Requires Good Pre-treatment Fit:** If no combination of donor units can match the treated unit before the intervention, the method is not credible.\n",
    "- **Convex Hull:** The treated unit's characteristics must lie within the \"convex hull\" of the donor units' characteristics.\n",
    "- **Interpolation, not Extrapolation:** It cannot estimate the effect of an intervention that is entirely outside the historical experience of the donor pool."
