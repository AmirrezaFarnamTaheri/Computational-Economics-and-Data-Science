    "### Introduction: The Economics of When to Act\n",
    "Many economic decisions are not about *how much* to do something, but *when* to do it. A firm decides when to make an irreversible investment. A job seeker decides when to accept a wage offer. A household decides when to sell their house. These are all **optimal stopping problems**.\n",
    "\n",
    "An optimal stopping problem is a special type of dynamic programming problem where, at each point in time, the agent faces a simple binary choice: **STOP** or **CONTINUE**.\n",
    "- **STOP:** End the process and receive a terminal payoff. This decision is irreversible.\n",
    "- **CONTINUE:** Forgo the stopping payoff, receive any flow payoff for the current period, and face the same decision again in the next period, where the state of the world may have changed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The agent must find a rule—a mapping from states to actions—that maximizes their total expected discounted payoff. This notebook introduces the formal structure of these problems and solves canonical applications from labor economics, corporate finance, and asset pricing."

    "#### 1.1 The Secretary Problem: A Finite Horizon Example\n",
    "The classic \"Secretary Problem\" provides a clean, analytical introduction to the logic of optimal stopping. An administrator wishes to hire the best secretary out of $N$ candidates, interviewed in random order. After each interview, the administrator must immediately decide to either hire the candidate (and stop the search) or reject them forever. The goal is to maximize the probability of hiring the single best candidate.\n",
    "\n",
    "The state is the information available: the number of candidates interviewed so far ($k$) and whether the current candidate is the best seen *so far*. The optimal strategy can be found via backward induction. It takes the form of a simple threshold rule: reject the first $r-1$ candidates, and then hire the first subsequent candidate who is better than all previous ones. The optimal threshold $r$ for large $N$ approaches $N/e$, where $e \\approx 2.718$. This means it is optimal to let the first $\\approx 37\\%$ of candidates go by to establish a benchmark, and then hire the next \"best so far\" candidate."

    "A cornerstone of modern corporate finance is the **real options** approach to investment. A firm has the option to pay a fixed, sunk cost $I$ to build a factory. The factory's value, $P_t$, follows a geometric Brownian motion: $dP = \\mu P dt + \\sigma P dZ_t$. The firm must choose the optimal time to invest.\n",

Economic conditions rule out the explosive positive root, so $F(P) = A P^\\gamma$. The solution is found by imposing boundary conditions (value matching and smooth pasting) at the optimal investment threshold $P^*$. This yields the solution for the investment threshold:\n",

The term $\\frac{\\gamma_1}{\\gamma_1 - 1} > 1$ is the **real options multiplier**.

For $N=100$, simulate the process 10,000 times for different rejection thresholds `r`. Plot the success probability as a function of `r`. Does the maximum occur near $r=100/e$?\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Comparative Statics (Benefits):** How does the reservation wage in the McCall model change if unemployment benefits `c` increase from 25 to 35? Re-solve for the new reservation wage. Does the average unemployment duration increase or decrease? Explain the economic intuition.\n",

    "3.  **Comparative Statics (Volatility):** For the real options investment model, plot the optimal investment threshold $P^*$ as a function of volatility $\\sigma$. How does increased uncertainty affect the option value of waiting and the firm's willingness to invest? \n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **On-the-Job Search:** Extend the McCall model to include on-the-job search. An employed worker with wage `w` gets a new wage offer `w'` with some probability `λ` each period. The Bellman equation for an *employed* worker is now: $V(w) = w + \\beta [ (1-\\lambda)V(w) + \\lambda E[\\max(V(w'), V(w))] ]$. Solve this more complex problem using VFI. How does the possibility of on-the-job search affect the initial reservation wage of an unemployed worker?\n",

    "5.  **American Call Option:** An American *call* option gives the right to *buy* the asset at strike price K. Its stopping value is $\\max(S-K, 0)$. It is famously never optimal to exercise an American call option on a non-dividend-paying stock before expiration. Can you modify the VFI code for the American put to price a call option and verify this result? (Hint: The value of the American call should be identical to the value of a European call)."
