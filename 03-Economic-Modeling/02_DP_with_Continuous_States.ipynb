    "The dynamic programming methods we studied in the previous chapter all relied on **discretizing the state space**. We represented a continuous state variable with a finite grid of points and solved for the value/policy functions at these points, using interpolation to fill in the gaps. This chapter introduces a more advanced and scalable solution: **function approximation**.\n",

    "Instead of finding the value of the function at every grid point, we approximate the entire value function (or policy function) using a flexible, parameterized functional form, such as a linear combination of **Chebyshev polynomials**. The goal is to find the set of parameters that makes our approximation as close as possible to the true, unknown function. This chapter will introduce three powerful methods for doing so:\n",

    "The Endogenous Grid Method, developed by Carroll (2006), cleverly avoids the repeated maximization step. Instead of fixing a grid for the state variable (wealth, $w$) and finding the optimal consumption for each grid point, EGM fixes a grid for the agent's choice *at the end of the period* and finds the corresponding state that makes that choice optimal.\n",
    "\n",

    "$$ u'(c_t) = \\beta R E_t[u'(c_{t+1})] $$\n",
    "\n",
    "EGM works backward from a known policy function in the next period ($c_{t+1}$) to find the optimal policy today ($c_t$). Here is the logic:\n",
    "1.  **Start at the end:** Assume we know the optimal consumption rule in the next period, $c_{t+1}(w')$.\n",
    "2.  **Choose an endogenous grid:** Instead of an exogenous grid on today's wealth ($w_t$), we create a grid for *end-of-period assets*, which we'll call $a_t$. This is the amount of wealth left *after* consumption today.\n",
    "3.  **Calculate future consumption:** For each point on our $a_t$ grid, we know that tomorrow's wealth will be $w_{t+1} = R a_t$. We can then use the known future consumption rule to find $c_{t+1}(R a_t)$.\n",
    "4.  **Invert the Euler Equation:** Now, we can use the Euler equation to find today's optimal consumption, $c_t$, that corresponds to each choice of $a_t$:\n",
    "    $$ c_t = (u')^{-1}(\\beta R E_t[u'(c_{t+1}(R a_t))]) $$\n",
    "    where $(u')^{-1}$ is the inverse of the marginal utility function. This step is analytical and fast—no numerical optimization is needed!\n",
    "5.  **Find the endogenous wealth grid:** We have a set of optimal consumption choices $c_t$ and the corresponding end-of-period assets $a_t$. We can find the level of wealth today, $w_t$, that would lead to these choices using the budget constraint: $w_t = c_t + a_t$. This gives us an \"endogenous\" grid of wealth points.\n",
    "6.  **Interpolate:** We now have the policy function $c(w_t)$ on an uneven, endogenous grid. We can use interpolation to get the policy function on our original, evenly spaced grid, and we are ready for the next iteration.\n",

    "### 5. Exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Accuracy vs. Degree:** Re-solve the stochastic growth model using the Euler Equation method with different degrees for the Chebyshev polynomial (e.g., N=10, 20, 30). How does the maximum absolute Euler equation residual (evaluated on a fine grid) change as you increase the degree? Plot the maximum residual for each degree.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Log-Utility:** The log-utility function, $u(c) = \\ln(c)$, is the special case of CRRA where `γ=1`. Modify the EGM solver to work with log utility (you will need to change `u_prime` and `u_prime_inv`). How does the policy function change?\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **The Role of Interest Rates:** Using the EGM solver, resolve the model for a higher interest rate (`R_INTEREST = 0.05`) and a lower one (`R_INTEREST = 0.01`). Plot the three policy functions (for the low, medium, and high interest rates) for the high-income state. How does the interest rate affect savings behavior? Explain the income and substitution effects at play.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **Implement Time Iteration:** The Euler Equation method shown is a form of time iteration. A simpler version iterates on the policy function directly. Given a policy approximation $\\hat{c}_k$, compute the RHS of the Euler equation to get the target consumption $c_{k+1}$. Then find the coefficients for the new policy approximation $\\hat{c}_{k+1}$. Implement this method and compare its convergence speed to the other methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.  **2D Approximation:** Consider a model where the agent has two assets, a liquid one ($a_1$) and an illiquid one ($a_2$). The value function is now $V(a_1, a_2, y)$. To approximate this, you would use a 2D basis of Chebyshev polynomials: $V(a_1, a_2) \\approx \\sum_{i=0}^{N-1}\\sum_{j=0}^{N-1} \\theta_{ij} T_i(a_1) T_j(a_2)$. How many coefficients would you need for a degree-5 approximation in each asset dimension? Why does this illustrate the curse of dimensionality?"
