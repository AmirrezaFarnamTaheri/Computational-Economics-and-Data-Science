        "The models we have studied so far assume the agent knows the true probability distribution governing random shocks. This is the world of **risk**. However, in many real-world situations, agents face a er form of uncertainty, often called **Knightian uncertainty** or **ambiguity**, where the true probability model itself is unknown. Agents may have a baseline model they believe is a good approximation, but they fear it might be misspecified in ways they cannot precisely quantify.\n",

It models an agent who is not only risk-averse but also **ambiguity-averse**. Such an agent chooses policies that are **robust**\u2014that is, policies that perform reasonably well across a whole set of plausible alternative models, not just the single baseline model they think is most likely."

        "The standard expected utility model of von Neumann and Morgenstern is derived from a set of axioms about preference, including **completeness** (any two lotteries can be compared) and **transitivity**. However, the key axiom is the **independence axiom**, which states that if an agent prefers lottery A to lottery B, they must also prefer a mix of A and C to a mix of B and C.\n",

        "The famous **Ellsberg paradox** showed that people systematically violate this axiom in the presence of ambiguity. This led to the development of alternative axiomatic systems. The model of **Gilboa and Schmeidler (1989)** relaxes the independence axiom and replaces it with a weaker **uncertainty aversion axiom**. This new set of axioms leads not to a single expected utility representation, but to a **max-min expected utility** representation, where the agent has a set of plausible probability distributions and evaluates a choice by the worst possible expected utility across that set. This provides the theoretical justification for the max-min structure of robust control."
