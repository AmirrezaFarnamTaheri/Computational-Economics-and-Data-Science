    "## The Economist's Need for Speed\n",
    "\n",
    "Economic models, especially those involving simulation, optimization, or repeated estimation, are often computationally intensive. A common bottleneck is the execution speed of pure Python code. While Python is lauded for its readability and ease of use, it is an interpreted language, and its loops can be orders of magnitude slower than compiled languages like C, C++, or Fortran.\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditionally, overcoming this involved complex workflows: writing performance-critical code in a low-level language, compiling it, and then writing Python \"wrappers\" to call it. This process is time-consuming and requires multi-language expertise.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Numba** changes this paradigm. Numba is a **Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler** that translates a subset of Python and NumPy code into fast, native machine code. It allows you to achieve performance comparable to C or Fortran without ever leaving the Python ecosystem.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you will learn:\n",
    "- What JIT compilation is and how it works.\n",
    "- How to use Numba's decorators to accelerate your functions with a single line of code.\n",
    "- How to benchmark and quantify the dramatic performance gains.\n",
    "- Best practices for using Numba effectively."

    "### A Canonical Example: The Monte Carlo Pi Simulation\n",
    "\n",
    "A simple way to demonstrate Numba's power is with a Monte Carlo simulation to estimate \\( \\pi \\). The logic is as follows:\n",
    "1. Imagine a square with side length 2, centered at the origin. Its area is 4.\n",
    "2. Inscribe a circle with radius 1 within this square. Its area is \\( \\pi r^2 = \\pi \\).\n",
    "3. Generate a large number of random points \\( (x, y) \\) within the square.\n",
    "4. The proportion of points that fall inside the circle should be equal to the ratio of the circle's area to the square's area: \\( \\frac{\\text{Points in Circle}}{\\text{Total Points}} \\approx \\frac{\\pi}{4} \\).\n",
    "5. Therefore, \\( \\pi \\approx 4 \\times \\frac{\\text{Points in Circle}}{\\text{Total Points}} \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "A point \\( (x, y) \\) is inside the circle if \\( x^2 + y^2 < 1 \\). This requires a loop, which is notoriously slow in pure Python."

    "## When to Use Numba\n",
    "\n",
    "Numba is not a silver bullet. It works best on a specific type of problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Numerically-Oriented Code:** It is designed for numerical data types (integers, floats) and NumPy arrays.\n",
    "- **Loops:** Numba's biggest advantage is in accelerating loops.\n",
    "- **Avoid Unsupported Python Features:** Numba does not support all of Python. It does not work well with pandas DataFrames, dictionaries, or complex class structures. The best practice is to isolate your slow, looping, numerical code into a dedicated function and apply Numba to that function.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Numba is an essential tool for any computational economist. It provides a remarkably simple and powerful way to break through the performance barriers of pure Python. By using the `@njit` decorator on functions that contain computationally-heavy loops over numerical data, you can often achieve speedups of 100x or more, turning a coffee break-long computation into a near-instantaneous one. This allows for more complex models, more extensive simulations, and faster iteration in your research."
