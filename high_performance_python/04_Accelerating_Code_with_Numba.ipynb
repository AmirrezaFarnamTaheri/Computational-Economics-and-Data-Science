    "# 4. Accelerating Python Code with Numba\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Economist's Need for Speed\n",
    "\n",
    "Economic models, especially those involving simulation, optimization, or repeated estimation, are often computationally intensive. A common bottleneck is the execution speed of pure Python code. While Python is lauded for its readability and ease of use, it is an interpreted language, and its loops can be orders of magnitude slower than compiled languages like C, C++, or Fortran.\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditionally, overcoming this involved complex workflows: writing performance-critical code in a low-level language, compiling it, and then writing Python \"wrappers\" to call it. This process is time-consuming and requires multi-language expertise.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Numba** changes this paradigm. Numba is a **Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler** that translates a subset of Python and NumPy code into fast, native machine code. It allows you to achieve performance comparable to C or Fortran without ever leaving the Python ecosystem.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you will learn:\n",
    "- What JIT compilation is and how it works.\n",
    "- How to use Numba's decorators to accelerate your functions with a single line of code.\n",
    "- How to benchmark and quantify the performance gains.\n",
    "- Best practices for using Numba effectively."

    "### What is a Decorator?\n",
    "\n",
    "Before diving into Numba, it's useful to understand the concept of a **decorator**. In Python, a decorator is a special syntax that allows you to modify or enhance a function without permanently changing its code. It's a function that takes another function as input and returns a modified function as output. You'll recognize them by the `@` symbol placed directly above a function definition.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, `@njit` is a decorator provided by the Numba library. When you write:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "@njit\n",
    "def my_function(x):\n",
    "    return x * 2\n",
    "```\n",
    "You are essentially telling Python to do this:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def my_function(x):\n",
    "    return x * 2\n",
    "my_function = njit(my_function)\n",
    "```\n",
    "The `@njit` decorator takes your original `my_function` and replaces it with a new, compiled, and highly optimized version."

    "### A Classic Example: The Monte Carlo Pi Simulation\n",
    "\n",
    "A simple way to demonstrate Numba's power is with a Monte Carlo simulation to estimate \\( \\pi \\). The logic is as follows:\n",
    "1. Imagine a square with side length 2, centered at the origin. Its area is 4.\n",
    "2. Inscribe a circle with radius 1 within this square. Its area is \\( \\pi r^2 = \\pi \\).\n",
    "3. Generate a large number of random points \\( (x, y) \\) within the square.\n",
    "4. The proportion of points that fall inside the circle should be equal to the ratio of the circle's area to the square's area: \\( \\frac{\\text{Points in Circle}}{\\text{Total Points}} \\approx \\frac{\\pi}{4} \\).\n",
    "5. Therefore, \\( \\pi \\approx 4 \\times \\frac{\\text{Points in Circle}}{\\text{Total Points}} \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "A point \\( (x, y) \\) is inside the circle if \\( x^2 + y^2 < 1 \\). This requires a loop, which is notoriously slow in pure Python."

    "To accelerate this function, we apply the `@njit` decorator. `njit` stands for **\"no-python JIT,\"** which is Numba's highest-performance mode. When the function is first called, Numba infers the data types of the variables (e.g., `num_samples` is an integer, `acc` is an integer, `x` and `y` are floats) and uses this information to compile a version of the function in machine code, tailored to these types.\n",

    "## Common Pitfalls and Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "Numba is powerful, but it's not a magic bullet. To use it effectively, it helps to know its limitations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Isolate Numerical Code:** Numba works best on functions that are purely numerical and contain loops. It does not support many standard Python data structures or libraries. For instance, **you cannot use pandas DataFrames or dictionaries inside a function decorated with `@njit`**. The best practice is to extract your data from DataFrames into NumPy arrays first, then pass those arrays to a specialized Numba function.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Type Stability:** Numba is fastest when the types of variables inside a function do not change. Code like `x = 1` followed later by `x = 1.0` can slow down Numba's optimizations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Check Compilation Mode:** If Numba cannot compile a function in `nopython` mode, it might fall back to a slower \"object mode,\" which shows little to no speedup. You can ensure Numba raises an error if it can't use `nopython` mode by using `@njit(nopython=True)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Numba is an essential tool for any computational economist. It provides a remarkably simple and powerful way to break through the performance barriers of pure Python. By using the `@njit` decorator on functions that contain computationally-heavy loops over numerical data, you can often achieve speedups of 100x or more, turning a long computation into a near-instantaneous one. This allows for more complex models, more extensive simulations, and faster iteration in your research."
