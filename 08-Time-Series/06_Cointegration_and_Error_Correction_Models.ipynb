    "\n",
    "A major challenge in econometrics is that most macroeconomic time series are non-stationary (typically I(1)). Regressing one non-stationary series on another can lead to a **spurious regression**: a regression that shows a statistically significant relationship between the variables, even when they are completely unrelated in reality. This happens because two independent random walks will both trend in some direction by pure chance, and OLS will pick up this coincidental correlation.\n",
    "\n",
    "<a id='spurious'></a>\n",
    "### Spurious Regression\n",
    "The tell-tale signs of a spurious regression are a very high $R^2$ combined with a very low Durbin-Watson statistic (indicating highly autocorrelated residuals). The residuals themselves will be non-stationary. This suggests that the model has not captured a true economic relationship, but merely a coincidental trend."

    "## 2. Cointegration: The Long-Run Relationship\n",
    "\n",
    "While regressing one I(1) series on another is generally problematic, there is a crucial exception. The concept of **cointegration**, developed by **Clive Granger** and **Robert Engle** (work for which they shared the 2003 Nobel Prize), provides a framework for modeling meaningful long-run relationships between non-stationary variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition: Cointegration**\n",
    "A set of I(1) variables are said to be cointegrated if there exists a linear combination of them that is stationary, I(0). This stationary linear combination is called the **cointegrating equation** and is interpreted as the long-run equilibrium relationship between the variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of two drunkards walking home from a bar. Each person's path is a random walk (I(1)). However, they are holding hands, so they cannot drift infinitely far apart from each other. Their individual paths are non-stationary, but the *distance between them* is stationary. They are cointegrated.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Visualization of Cointegration](../images/png/cointegration_visualization.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if consumption ($c_t$) and income ($y_t$) are both I(1), but the linear combination $c_t - \\beta y_t = u_t$ is I(0), then consumption and income are cointegrated. The term $u_t$ represents the deviation from the long-run equilibrium. While consumption and income can drift apart in the short run, the fact that $u_t$ is stationary means they cannot wander arbitrarily far from each other; there is an economic force that pulls them back to their long-run relationship."

For example, a negative $\\alpha_1$ means that if $y_1$ was too high relative to its long-run relationship with $y_2$ in the previous period, it will tend to decrease in the current period, moving back towards equilibrium."

    "\n",
    "1.  **Error Correction Section (`alpha` coefficients):**\n",
    "    - This section shows the **speed of adjustment** coefficients. The `alpha` for the `Delta(LogCons)` equation tells us how quickly consumption responds to deviations from the long-run equilibrium.\n",
    "    - A statistically significant and negative coefficient (e.g., -0.05) would mean that when consumption is above its long-run path relative to income, it adjusts downwards by 5% of the deviation in the next quarter.\n",
    "    - The `alpha` for the `Delta(LogInc)` equation is often not significant, implying that income is 'weakly exogenous' and does not adjust to restore the equilibrium; rather, consumption does all the work.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Cointegrating-vector Section (`beta` coefficients):**\n",
    "    - This section shows the **long-run cointegrating relationship**. The coefficients are normalized. If the `beta` vector is `[1.0000, -0.9200]`, it means the long-run relationship is:\n",
    "      $$ LogCons_{t-1} - 0.92 \\times LogInc_{t-1} = 0 $$\n",
    "      $$ LogCons = 0.92 \\times LogInc $$\n",

It is a maximum likelihood-based test that can determine the **cointegration rank** (the number of cointegrating relationships) in a system of multiple time series. It is the standard approach for systems with more than two variables."

    "- **Error Correction Term**: The deviations from the long-run cointegrating relationship. Because this term is stationary, it tends to revert to its mean of zero.\\n",
    "- **Vector Error Correction Model (VECM)**: The appropriate model for cointegrated time series. It is a VAR in first-differences that includes the lagged error correction term, allowing it to model both short-run dynamics and the long-run equilibrium adjustment."

    "**1. Interpreting Cointegration:**\\n",
    "This means the two prices share a common stochastic trend and are bound by a long-run equilibrium relationship, likely enforced by arbitrage. While the prices can drift apart temporarily due to market frictions, they cannot deviate from each other indefinitely. The error correction term represents the (temporary) deviation from the law of one price, or the arbitrage opportunity. \\n",
    "\\n",
    "---\\n",
    "\\n",
    "**2. Engle-Granger Test:**\\n",
    "The null hypothesis of the ADF test on the residuals is that the residuals have a unit root (i.e., they are non-stationary). A rejection of the null means the residuals are stationary, which, by definition, implies that the original series are cointegrated.\\n",
    "\\n",
    "---\\n",
    "\\n",
    "**3. VECM vs. VAR in Differences:**\\n",
    "A standard VAR in first-differences is misspecified for cointegrated data because it throws away the crucial information about the long-run equilibrium relationship. By differencing all variables, you remove the common trend, but you also remove the information about how the variables move together in the long run. The VECM correctly includes this long-run information through the error correction term, leading to a better model specification and more accurate forecasts.\\n",
    "\\n",
    "---\\n",
    "\\n",
    "**4. Speed of Adjustment:**\\n",
    "An alpha coefficient of -0.2 in the consumption equation means that when consumption is above its long-run equilibrium level relative to income, it will adjust downwards in the next period to correct for about 20% of that deviation. It measures the speed at which consumption returns to the long-run path after a shock."
