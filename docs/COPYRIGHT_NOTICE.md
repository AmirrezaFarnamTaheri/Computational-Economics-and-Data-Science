# Notebook Copyright Notice Template

Add the following markdown cell at the top of each Jupyter notebook to clarify licensing for learners and collaborators:

```
> **License Notice**
> 
> This notebook is part of the *Computational Economics and Data Science* course.
> 
> - Code cells are released under the MIT License. You are free to use and adapt the code with attribution.
> - Text, figures, and other non-code content are released under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
> 
> Please retain this notice and credit Amirreza "Farnam" Taheri when sharing adaptations.
```

For notebooks that already contain attribution or acknowledgements, place this notice immediately after those sections to keep licensing information prominent.
