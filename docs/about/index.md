## Course Philosophy

### Learning by Doing

We believe the best way to learn computational economics is through:

1. **Active coding** - Type code yourself, don't just read
2. **Experimentation** - Modify parameters, try variations
3. **Real data** - Work with actual economic datasets
4. **Incremental complexity** - Build from foundations to advanced topics

### Rigor Meets Practicality

This course balances:

- **Theoretical foundations** - Understand the mathematics
- **Practical implementation** - Write working code
- **Economic intuition** - Know why methods work
- **Best practices** - Write production-quality code
