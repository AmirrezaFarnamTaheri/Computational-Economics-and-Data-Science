## Making Changes

### Code Style

Follow the project's [Code Style Guide](../resources/code-style.md):

**Python:**
- PEP 8 style
- NumPy-style docstrings
- Type hints where appropriate
- Meaningful variable names

**Notebooks:**
- Clear markdown explanations
- One concept per cell
- Output visible (run all cells)
- Kernel restarted before committing

**Example:**

```python
def calculate_present_value(future_value: float, rate: float, periods: int) -> float:
    """
    Calculate present value using the discount formula.

    Parameters
    ----------
    future_value : float
        Future cash flow value
    rate : float
        Discount rate (annual)
    periods : int
        Number of periods

    Returns
    -------
    float
        Present value

    Examples
    --------
    >>> calculate_present_value(110, 0.10, 1)
    100.0
    ```

### Testing

Run existing tests before submitting:

```bash
# Run Python tests
pytest

# Validate notebooks
python scripts/validate_notebooks.py

# Check code style
flake8 scripts/
```

### Commit Messages

Write clear, descriptive commit messages:

**Good:**
