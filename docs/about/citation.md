## Examples of Proper Attribution

### ✅ Correct Attribution

```python
"""
This code implements value function iteration for solving
dynamic programming problems.

Based on: Farnam Taheri, A. (2025). Computational Economics
and Data Science. https://github.com/AmirrezaFarnamTaheri/
Computational-Economics-and-Data-Science
Licensed under MIT.
"""

def value_iteration(V_init, params, tol=1e-6):
    # Implementation...
    pass
```

### ✅ Also Correct

In a Jupyter notebook:
```markdown
## Value Function Iteration

This notebook implements the value function iteration algorithm.

**Source:** Adapted from Module 3 of [Computational Economics and
Data Science](https://github.com/AmirrezaFarnamTaheri/
Computational-Economics-and-Data-Science) by Amirreza Farnam Taheri,
licensed under CC BY 4.0.
```

### ❌ Insufficient Attribution

```python
# From an online course
def value_iteration(V_init, params):
    pass
```

**Why insufficient:** No specific source, no author, no license information.
