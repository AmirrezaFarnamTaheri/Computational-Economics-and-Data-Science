    "This chapter provides a PhD-level treatment of **Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT)** and its evolution into empirical asset pricing. Markowitz's (1952) foundational insight was that the risk of a portfolio depends crucially on the **covariance** between its assets. This principle of **diversification** is the bedrock of modern asset allocation.\n",

    "\n",
    "The CAPM is a general equilibrium model that arises from combining MPT with two key assumptions: 1) all investors are rational mean-variance optimizers, and 2) there exists a **risk-free asset**. The introduction of a risk-free asset transforms the curved efficient frontier into a straight line known as the **Capital Market Line (CML)**. All rational investors will hold a combination of the risk-free asset and a single, unique portfolio of risky assets called the **tangency portfolio**. In equilibrium, since all investors hold the same risky portfolio, it must be the **market portfolio** itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "The CML describes the expected return for any efficient portfolio (a mix of the risk-free asset and the market portfolio) as a function of its **total risk** (standard deviation, $\\sigma_p$):\n",

It states that an asset's expected excess return is determined not by its total risk, but only by its non-diversifiable, **systematic risk**, as measured by its **beta** ($\\\beta_i$):\n",

The **Black-Litterman model** provides an elegant Bayesian solution. It starts with the returns implied by market equilibrium (the **prior**) and allows the investor to specify their own subjective **views**.

    "**1. CAPM Assumptions:**\\n",
    "   a. **Homogeneous Expectations:** The CAPM assumes all investors have the same beliefs about expected returns, variances, and covariances. In reality, investors have diverse opinions and information.\\n",
    "   b. **No Transaction Costs or Taxes:** The model assumes a frictionless market. In reality, trading incurs costs, and taxes affect returns, both of which can alter optimal portfolios.\\n",

    "\\n",
    "**2. Factor Investing Risks:**\\n",
    "- **SMB (Size):** The small-stock premium may be compensation for the higher risk of smaller firms, which are often less diversified, have less access to credit, and are more vulnerable to economic downturns.\\n",
    "- **HML (Value):** The value premium (high book-to-market stocks outperforming growth stocks) may be compensation for the risk of financial distress. Value firms are often mature, slower-growing companies that may be more sensitive to business cycle risk.\\n",
    "\\n",
    "---\\n",
    "\\n",
    "**3. Black-Litterman Confidence:**\\n",
    "If the investor is more confident in their view, the variance of that view (the diagonal elements of $\\Omega$) will be smaller. In the Bayesian updating formula, a smaller $\\Omega$ gives more weight to the investor's view ($Q$) and less weight to the market-implied prior ($\\Pi$). Therefore, the resulting posterior expected returns will be pulled further away from the prior and closer to the investor's specific view.\\n",
    "\\n",
    "---\\n",
    "\\n",
    "**4. SML vs CML:**\\n",
    "The CML plots expected return against **total risk** ($\\sigma$). Only perfectly diversified portfolios (combinations of the risk-free asset and the market portfolio) lie on the CML. An individual stock has both systematic (market) risk and idiosyncratic (firm-specific) risk. Its total risk, $\\sigma_i$, will be higher than is justified by its expected return, so it will lie *below* the CML. The SML, however, plots expected return against **systematic risk** ($\\beta$). According to the CAPM, all assets and portfolios, efficient or not, must lie on the SML in equilibrium. The market only compensates investors for bearing systematic risk, as idiosyncratic risk can be diversified away for free."
