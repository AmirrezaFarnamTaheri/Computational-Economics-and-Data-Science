    "## 1. Introduction to Continuous Time\n",
    "\n",
    "While discrete-time models are intuitive, much of modern financial theory is built using **continuous time**. This approach involves a steeper mathematical learning curve but yields models that are often more elegant, powerful, and analytically tractable. The ability to model the instantaneous evolution of variables and the continuous hedging of risk provides the foundation for the Black-Scholes-Merton formula and a vast range of subsequent research.\n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter introduces the essential toolkit for continuous-time analysis, focusing on its application to dynamic optimization problems. We build from the ground up, starting with the fundamental process for random walks (Brownian motion) and the special rules of calculus that apply to them (Itô's Lemma). We then introduce the continuous-time version of the Bellman equation—the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation—and use it to solve two canonical problems in finance:\n",

    "1.  **Merton's Portfolio Problem:** The classic model of optimal consumption and investment for an individual.\n",

    "### Itô's Lemma: The Chain Rule for Stochastic Processes\n",
    "\n",
    "To find the dynamics of a function of a stochastic process, $f(S_t, t)$, we cannot use the standard chain rule of calculus because the path of $S_t$ is not differentiable. We must use **Itô's Lemma**, which correctly accounts for the random nature of the process. It arises from a second-order Taylor expansion of $f(S,t)$:\n",
    "$$ df = \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial t} dt + \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial S} dS + \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial S^2} (dS)^2 + \\dots $$ \n",
    "The key insight of stochastic calculus involves the multiplication rules for the differentials $dt$ and $dW_t$. From the properties of Brownian motion, we have $(dW_t)^2 = dt$, while $(dt)^2 = 0$ and $dt \\cdot dW_t = 0$. Substituting the SDE for $dS$ and applying these rules:\n",
    "$$ (dS)^2 = (\\mu S dt + \\sigma S dW_t)^2 = (\\mu S dt)^2 + 2\\mu\\sigma S^2 dt dW_t + (\\sigma S dW_t)^2 = \\sigma^2 S^2 dt $$ \n",
    "Plugging this back into the Taylor expansion, we get the celebrated result:\n",
    "$$ df = \\left( \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial t} + \\mu S_t \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial S} + \\frac{1}{2} \\sigma^2 S_t^2 \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial S^2} \\right) dt + \\left( \\sigma S_t \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial S} \\right) dW_t $$ \n",
    "The presence of the second-order derivative term ($\\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial S^2}$), which arises from the non-zero quadratic variation of the process, is the crucial difference from standard calculus. For a convex function, the random up-and-down movements of the stochastic process do not cancel out; they lead to a systematic upward drift. This is visually demonstrated below. This term is fundamental to nearly every result in continuous-time finance, including the Black-Scholes-Merton formula."

    "## 3. Dynamic Optimization in Continuous Time: The HJB Equation\n",
    "\n",
    "The HJB equation is the continuous-time analogue of the discrete-time Bellman equation. It provides the necessary condition for an optimal control policy in a dynamic optimization problem. For an agent maximizing lifetime utility $E_0 \\int_0^\\infty e^{-\\rho t} u(C_t) dt$ subject to a wealth dynamic $dW_t$, the HJB equation for the value function $V(W)$ is:\n",

    "\n",
    "**Intuition:** The HJB equation is an asset-pricing equation for the value function itself. The left side, $\\rho V(W)$, is the required return on the \"asset\" of being alive with wealth $W$, where $\\rho$ is the agent's subjective discount rate. It's the total return you would demand from this \"asset of life.\" The right side is the actual return you get from optimally managing your life at this instant. This actual return has two components: a \"dividend\" from the asset (the flow utility you get from consumption, $u(C_t)$) and its expected \"capital gain\" (the expected change in the value of your life, $\\frac{E_t[dV]}{dt}$). In equilibrium, the required return must equal the maximized actual return."

    "### The Martingale Pricing Framework and State-Price Density\n",
    "\n",
    "A powerful result from the HJB framework is that the agent's optimized marginal utility of wealth acts as the **state-price density (SPD)**, or stochastic discount factor (SDF), for the economy. The SPD, $\\xi_t$, is the process that can be used to value any asset by computing the expected present value of its future payoffs. For our CRRA agent, the SPD is:\n",
    "$$ \\xi_t = e^{-\\rho t} u'(C_t) = e^{-\\rho t} (\\delta W_t)^{-\\gamma} $$\n",
    "The price of any asset with payoff $X_T$ at time $T$ is given by $P_t = E_t[\\frac{\\xi_T}{\\xi_t} X_T]$. This provides a deep link between equilibrium-based macro models (like Merton's) and the arbitrage-free pricing models of finance.\n",

    "### Deriving the Black-Scholes-Merton PDE\n",
    "We can use this framework to derive the BSM PDE without relying on the specific preferences of an agent. Let $f(S,t)$ be the price of a derivative on a stock $S$. The total return on a portfolio that is long the derivative and short $\\Delta$ shares of the stock is $df - \\Delta dS$. If we choose the hedge ratio $\\Delta = f_S$ (the partial derivative of $f$ with respect to $S$), Itô's Lemma shows that the resulting portfolio is risk-free. By no-arbitrage, this risk-free portfolio must earn the risk-free rate, $r$. This logic leads directly to the BSM PDE:\n",
    "$$ \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial t} + rS \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial S} + \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2 S^2 \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial S^2} - rf = 0 $$\n",
    "This demonstrates that the BSM pricing formula is independent of risk preferences (the drift $\\mu$ and the agent's utility function drop out), which is a cornerstone of modern derivatives pricing."

    "This notebook introduced the core concepts of continuous-time finance, a framework that underpins much of modern financial theory.\n",
    "- **Stochastic Calculus**, particularly **Itô's Lemma**, provides the rules for differentiating functions of random processes and is essential for modeling in continuous time.\n",
    "- The **Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation** is the fundamental condition for optimality in continuous-time dynamic problems, analogous to the Bellman equation in discrete time.\n",
    "- **Merton's portfolio problem** provides an elegant, closed-form solution for optimal consumption and investment, showing that the share allocated to risky assets is proportional to the equity premium and inversely proportional to risk and risk aversion.\n",
    "- The HJB framework is deeply connected to **arbitrage-free pricing**. The agent's marginal utility process serves as the economy's stochastic discount factor, and the no-arbitrage condition can be used to derive the celebrated **Black-Scholes-Merton PDE** for option pricing."

    "## 7. Exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Itô's Lemma Practice:** Let $S_t$ follow a Geometric Brownian Motion as defined in section 2. Use Itô's Lemma to find the SDE for the process $f(S_t) = \\ln(S_t)$. What does this result tell you about the distribution of log-returns in this model?\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Log Utility:** The case where $\\gamma \\to 1$ corresponds to logarithmic utility, $u(C) = \\ln(C)$. Using the `MertonProblem` class, set `gamma=1.01` (to avoid issues with the formula) and find the optimal risky share $\\alpha^*$ and consumption rate $\\delta^*$. How do they compare to the baseline case where $\\gamma=3$? Explain the intuition.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Myopic vs. Hedging Demand:** The Merton solution for $\\alpha^*$ is often called the **\"myopic\" demand** because it only depends on current market conditions. In more advanced models where investment opportunities are stochastic (e.g., $\\mu$ or $\\sigma$ change over time), a second **\"intertemporal hedging\"** demand term appears in the optimal portfolio. Why might an investor want to hold *more* of the risky asset than the myopic portfolio suggests if they know that market volatility is mean-reverting and currently high?\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **State-Price Density Dynamics:** Using the solution for the Merton problem and Itô's lemma, find the SDE for the state-price density, $\\xi_t = e^{-\\rho t} (\\delta W_t)^{-\\gamma}$. Show that its expected return is the negative of the risk-free rate, $E[d\\xi / \\xi] = -r dt$.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.  **Solving the HJB:** The final step in the Merton problem is to substitute the optimal policies for $C^*$ and $\\alpha^*$ back into the HJB equation and solve the resulting differential equation for the value function $V(W)$. Perform this substitution (using pen and paper or `SymPy`) and show that the guessed functional form $V(W) = A W^{1-\\gamma}$ is indeed a solution, and solve for the constant $A$."
