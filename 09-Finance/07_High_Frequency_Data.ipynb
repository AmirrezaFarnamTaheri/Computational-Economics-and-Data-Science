    "- **Market Depth:** The volume of orders available at the best bid and ask, and at other price levels. Deeper markets are more liquid as they can absorb larger trades without a significant price impact.\n",
    "- **Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP):** The average price of a stock over a given time period, weighted by the volume of trades at each price. It is often used as a benchmark for execution quality. A trader who buys below the VWAP has achieved a good execution."

    "### 3. Realized Volatility and Microstructure Noise\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most powerful applications of high-frequency data is the ability to compute a precise, model-free measure of volatility. While GARCH models *estimate* conditional volatility based on daily data, **realized volatility** *measures* the actual volatility that occurred over a period (e.g., a day) by summing the squared high-frequency returns.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we have intraday returns $r_{t,j}$ (e.g., from 5-minute intervals), the realized variance for day $t$ is:\n",
    "$$ RV_t = \\sum_{j=1}^{M} r_{t,j}^2 $$\n",
    "The annualized realized volatility is then $\\sqrt{252 \\cdot RV_t}$. This provides a much more accurate measure of daily volatility than can be obtained from daily data alone.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Challenge of Microstructure Noise:**\n",
    "In theory, the more frequently we sample returns (e.g., every second), the more accurate our realized volatility measure should be. In practice, this is not true. At very high frequencies, the observed prices are contaminated by **market microstructure noise**, such as the price bouncing between the bid and ask prices. This noise adds variance that is not part of the true price process.\n",
    "\n",
    "This leads to a trade-off: sampling too infrequently means we miss some of the true price variation, while sampling too frequently means our measure is contaminated by noise. The **volatility signature plot** is the standard diagnostic tool for visualizing this trade-off and choosing an appropriate sampling frequency. It plots the average realized volatility against the sampling interval."
