    "## 1. The Unifying Theory: The Stochastic Discount Factor (SDF)\n",
    "\n",
    "Why do some assets, on average, deliver higher returns than others? Asset pricing theory provides a framework for answering this fundamental question. The central idea is that an asset's expected return is a reward for its **systematic risk**—the risk that cannot be diversified away. This is the risk that is correlated with broad economic states of the world where an extra dollar of wealth is particularly valuable (i.e., \"bad times\").\n",
    "\n",
    "All modern asset pricing models can be unified under the elegant and powerful framework of the **Stochastic Discount Factor (SDF)**. The fundamental pricing equation states that the price of any asset, $p_t$, is the expected discounted value of its future payoff, $x_{t+1}$, where the discounting is done by the SDF, $m_{t+1}$:\n",
    "$$ p_t = E_t[m_{t+1} x_{t+1}] $$\n",
    "\n",
    "The SDF, also known as the pricing kernel, is a random variable that reflects the marginal utility of wealth in different future states of the world. It is high in \"bad times\" (when investors are poor and marginal utility is high) and low in \"good times.\" The equation can be rewritten in terms of gross returns, $R_{i, t+1} = x_{t+1}/p_t$, as:\n",
    "$$ 1 = E_t[m_{t+1} R_{i, t+1}] $$\n",
    "This implies that an asset's expected return is determined by its covariance with the SDF: assets that have low returns when the SDF is high (i.e., in bad times) are risky and must offer a higher expected return to compensate investors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Different asset pricing models are simply different assumptions about the specific form of the SDF, $m_{t+1}$.\n",
    "- **Consumption-Based CAPM (CCAPM):** Assumes the SDF is determined by the growth rate of aggregate consumption.\n",
    "- **Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM):** Assumes the SDF is a linear function of the return on the market portfolio.\n",
    "- **Multi-Factor Models:** Assume the SDF is a linear function of several risk factors (e.g., market, size, value).\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook traces this intellectual journey, starting with the foundational theoretical models and progressing to the multi-factor workhorses of modern empirical finance."

    "### Deriving the SDF from Micro-foundations\n",
    "The SDF is not an ad-hoc assumption; it arises naturally from the optimization problem of an economic agent. Consider a representative agent choosing consumption ($C_t$) and their holdings of an asset ($z_t$) to maximize lifetime utility:\n",
    "$$ \\max E_0 \\sum_{t=0}^\\infty \\beta^t u(C_t) \\quad \\text{s.t.} \\quad C_t + p_t z_t = (p_t + d_t)z_{t-1} $$\n",
    "where $p_t$ is the asset price and $d_t$ is its dividend. The first-order condition with respect to asset holdings $z_t$ is:\n",
    "$$ -p_t u'(C_t) + E_t[\\beta u'(C_{t+1})(p_{t+1} + d_{t+1})] = 0 $$\n",
    "Rearranging this gives the fundamental asset pricing equation:\n",
    "$$ p_t = E_t \\left[ \\underbrace{\\beta \\frac{u'(C_{t+1})}{u'(C_t)}}_{m_{t+1}} (p_{t+1} + d_{t+1}) \\right] = E_t[m_{t+1} x_{t+1}] $$\n",
    "This shows that the Stochastic Discount Factor is the **intertemporal marginal rate of substitution**. It is the rate at which an investor is willing to trade consumption today for consumption tomorrow, and it is this rate that is used to discount future payoffs.\n",

    "## 2. Model 1: The Consumption-Based CAPM (CCAPM) and its Puzzles\n",
    "\n",
    "The CCAPM is the most theoretically pure asset pricing model. It arises from specifying a particular functional form for the utility function in the derivation above. For a consumer with a power utility function $u(C) = \\frac{C^{1-\\gamma}}{1-\\gamma}$, the marginal utility is $u'(C) = C^{-\\gamma}$. Plugging this into the definition of the SDF gives the famous result:\n",
    "$$ m_{t+1} = \\beta \\left( \\frac{C_{t+1}}{C_t} \\right)^{-\\gamma} $$\n",
    "where $\\beta$ is the subjective discount factor and $\\gamma$ is the coefficient of relative risk aversion. Substituting this into the fundamental pricing equation yields the CCAPM:\n",
    "$$ E_t[R_i] - R_f = \\text{Cov}_t\\left(R_i, -\\frac{\\Delta C_{t+1}}{C_t}\\right) \\cdot \\gamma $$\n",
    "The model predicts that an asset's excess return is determined by its covariance with aggregate consumption growth. Assets that pay off when consumption is low (e.g., insurance) are valuable and have low expected returns, while assets that do poorly when consumption is low (e.g., cyclical stocks) are risky and must have high expected returns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite its theoretical elegance, the CCAPM performs poorly empirically, leading to two famous puzzles:\n",
    "1.  **The Equity Premium Puzzle (Mehra & Prescott, 1985):** Historically, the US equity premium (the return of stocks over bonds) has been around 6-8%. Aggregate consumption growth is very smooth (low variance). To explain the high equity premium with a low consumption variance, the CCAPM requires an implausibly high coefficient of risk aversion ($\\gamma > 30$).\n",
    "2.  **The Risk-Free Rate Puzzle:** With a high $\\gamma$, the model predicts a very high risk-free rate, far higher than the ~1-2% observed historically. This is because a high $\\gamma$ implies a strong desire for intertemporal substitution, leading agents to save heavily and drive up the price of risk-free assets (driving down their return)."

    "## 3. Model 2: The Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)\n",
    "\n",
    "Frustrated by the empirical failures of the CCAPM, finance academics developed models where the SDF is a function of asset returns themselves, which are more volatile and have a higher correlation with individual stock returns. The CAPM is the most famous example. It assumes the SDF is a linear function of the return on the market portfolio, $R_m$. This gives rise to the classic CAPM equation:\n",
    "$$ E[R_i] - R_f = \\beta_i (E[R_m] - R_f) $$\n",
    "Where beta, $\\beta_i = \\frac{\\text{Cov}(R_i, R_m)}{\\text{Var}(R_m)}$, measures the asset's systematic risk exposure to the market portfolio.\n",

    "$$ (R_{it} - R_{ft}) = \\alpha_i + \\beta_i (R_{mt} - R_{ft}) + \\epsilon_{it} $$\n",
    "The intercept, **Jensen's alpha**, is the key test. The CAPM predicts $\\alpha_i=0$ for all assets. A non-zero alpha indicates that an asset has earned returns that are unexplained by its market risk, representing a model anomaly."

Their five-factor model is an empirical model where the SDF is assumed to be a linear function of five factors: market, size, value, profitability, and investment.\n",
    "\n",
    "The regression equation is:\n",

    "The previous analysis shows *how* assets load on factors. But it doesn't answer a more fundamental question: do these factors actually carry a risk premium? In other words, does the market reward investors with higher average returns for taking on, for example, value risk (a high HML beta)?\n",
    "\n",
    "To answer this, we turn to the **Fama-MacBeth (1973) two-step regression** procedure, a cornerstone of empirical asset pricing. It is designed to test whether the risk premium associated with a factor is statistically significant.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Two-Step Procedure:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **First Pass (Time-Series Regression):** For each of the $N$ assets (e.g., stocks or portfolios) in our sample, we run a time-series regression of its excess returns on the proposed risk factors. This gives us a set of factor loadings (betas), $\\hat{\\beta}_{i,k}$, for each asset $i$ on each factor $k$. These betas measure the sensitivity of the asset's return to the factor's movements.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Second Pass (Cross-Sectional Regressions):** For *each time period* $t$, we run a single cross-sectional regression of all asset returns at that time $t$ on the betas we estimated in the first pass. The coefficients from this regression, $\\hat{\\lambda}_{k,t}$, are interpreted as the **risk premium** for factor $k$ at time $t$.\n",
    "\n",
    "After running the second pass for all $T$ time periods, we have a time series of risk premia estimates for each factor. The average risk premium for factor $k$ is the time-series average of these estimates, $\\bar{\\lambda}_k$. We use a t-statistic to test if this average premium is statistically different from zero. If it is, we conclude that the factor is \"priced\".\n",

    "### Analysis and Interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "The results from the Fama-MacBeth regressions, now with robust Newey-West standard errors, allow us to test which factors command a statistically significant risk premium. We look at the **T-statistic (NW)** and **P-value (NW)** columns. A factor is considered \"priced\" if its p-value is below a conventional significance level (e.g., 0.05), which corresponds to a t-statistic with an absolute value greater than approximately 1.96.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **CAPM Results:**\n",
    "    - The table shows the risk premium for the market factor (MKT). By examining its t-statistic and p-value, we can determine if systematic market risk is rewarded.\n",
    "    - The intercept (`const`) represents the average excess return of a portfolio with zero beta. According to the CAPM, this should be zero. The t-statistic tells us if the observed intercept is statistically distinguishable from zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Fama-French 5-Factor Results:** The multi-factor model provides a more nuanced picture:\n",
    "    - We again check the **MKT** premium. Does it remain significant after controlling for the other factors?\n",
    "    - **HML (Value):** A significant positive premium would confirm the \"value effect\"—that the market rewards investors for holding high book-to-market (value) stocks.\n",
    "    - **RMW (Profitability):** A significant premium indicates that profitability is a priced risk factor.\n",
    "    - **SMB (Size)** and **CMA (Investment):** We examine the significance of these factors to see if size and investment patterns are rewarded with higher average returns.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusion:** By comparing the results of the two models, we can assess whether the Fama-French 5-factor model provides a better description of the cross-section of returns than the single-factor CAPM. The factors with statistically significant t-statistics are the ones that are robustly priced sources of systematic risk over our sample period."

    "## 7. Exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **The SDF Framework:** Explain the Stochastic Discount Factor (SDF) equation $1 = E[m R_i]$. What is the economic intuition of the SDF, $m$? How can this single equation give rise to both the CCAPM and the Fama-French models under different assumptions about what $m$ is?\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Equity Premium Puzzle:** In your own words, what is the Equity Premium Puzzle? Why can't the standard CCAPM, with a reasonable level of risk aversion (e.g., $\\gamma < 10$), explain the historically high excess return of the stock market? What does this imply about the covariance between consumption growth and stock market returns?\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Alternative Test Assets:** Rerun the Fama-MacBeth analysis in the case study, but instead of the 10 Industry Portfolios, use the `25_Portfolios_5x5` (portfolios sorted on size and book-to-market) as the test assets. Do the conclusions about which factors are priced change? Why might using these portfolios provide a more powerful test?\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **Interpreting Alpha:** In the 5-factor model time-series regressions (the first pass), if a portfolio still had a significant positive alpha, what would be the possible interpretations? Does it necessarily imply market inefficiency, or could it point to missing risk factors not captured by the Fama-French 5? What kind of risk might be missing (e.g., momentum, liquidity)?\n",
    "5.  **Arbitrage Pricing Theory (APT):** Research the Arbitrage Pricing Theory (APT) proposed by Stephen Ross. How does its derivation of a multi-factor model differ from the equilibrium-based approach of the CAPM? Which set of assumptions do you find more plausible?"

    "## 8. Summary and Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provided a tour of modern empirical asset pricing, unified by the concept of the Stochastic Discount Factor. We journeyed from the elegant but empirically challenged CCAPM to the workhorse factor models that dominate empirical research today.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Takeaways:**\n",
    "- The **SDF equation** ($p_t = E_t[m_{t+1} x_{t+1}]$) is the unifying principle of all asset pricing.\n",
    "- Different models are just different specifications of the SDF, $m_{t+1}$.\n",
    "- The **CCAPM**, while theoretically pure, fails to match the data due to the smoothness of consumption growth (the Equity Premium Puzzle).\n",
    "- The **CAPM** simplifies the SDF to be a linear function of the market return, providing a better, though incomplete, description of risk.\n",
    "- **Multi-factor models**, like the Fama-French 5-Factor model, capture more dimensions of systematic risk (size, value, profitability, investment) and provide a much better explanation of the cross-section of stock returns.\n",
    "- The **Fama-MacBeth regression** is the standard tool for testing whether these systematic risk factors carry a statistically significant risk premium. Our analysis showed that market, value, and profitability risk have been historically rewarded."
